         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:105665:6"/> Whether they be thoſe that prophane the Sabbath, by <hi>unneceſſary Journyings,</hi> or Labours, or Recreation, and do not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſpend it in the publick and private Duties of Gods Worſhip? For their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour towards men, Are they generally the <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> of this age, that dare curſe their <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Mothers,</hi> and reproach the Womb that bare them? Are they <hi>Murtherers, Thieves, Adulterers, Fornicators, Perjured Perſons?</hi> Do they not generally make Conſcience to <hi>Owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to any, but to love one another,</hi> to deal juſtly with men? I will not ſpeak for every Individual (Chriſt had a <hi>Judas</hi> in his Flock.) Nor do I reflect on any others; I know there are many that are no <hi>Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> who are Pious towards God, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous towards Men. I would only have theſe on both ſides made one. What have their worſt Enemies to <hi>Object,</hi> but <hi>diſobedience</hi> to an <hi>Humane Law</hi> in matter of <hi>Divine Worſhip,</hi> wherein they do in all ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty profeſs they cannot do, or omit the thing commanded or, forbidden without ſinning againſt God.

THou haſt found me ſo unhandſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Repreſented in a Book of Dr. <hi>Falkners,</hi> which he calleth, <hi>A Vindication of Liturgies:</hi> To which I have here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned an Anſwer, that I cannot but judge it reaſonable, that I ſhould introduce thee into my following Diſcourſe, with a Character of my ſelf I had my time of <hi>Childhood</hi> and <hi>Vanity</hi> as well as others, and, perhaps, did my ſelf once think, that there was no ſuch Service of God as by <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer.</hi> But ſince I began to write <hi>Man,</hi> ſince I underſtood any
<pb facs="tcp:105665:12"/> thing of <hi>Communion with God,</hi> ſince I entred into the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> (which is now Thirty four Years) I have ſeen what I judged reaſon to be of another mind. My whole Miniſtry hath been ordinarily exerciſed in one and the ſame place, where my Converſation hath been expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a ſufficient view. As the time of my appearing to the World will clear me from having Concerns in the late Wars, from having any thing to do in preſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng the <hi>Covenant,</hi> or the <hi>Ejecting, Silencing</hi> and <hi>Impriſoning</hi> Men for the refuſal of it. So it is enough to tell you, that I never came near an Army, nor ever ſaw the face of <hi>Oliver</hi> Lord Protector, nor ever had the leaſt Preferment from him, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment with him. I was always a man of a very <hi>open</hi> and <hi>free Converſe,</hi> and have had the honour of an Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Converſe with the moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men of the <hi>Epiſcopal, Presbyterian,</hi> or <hi>Congregational</hi> Perſuaſions, in the place where I lived, and elſewhere in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. <hi>Tros Tyriuſque mihi,</hi> &amp;c. Where I ſaw <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> I never made a difference, thinking, That the Kingdom of God lay not in theſe things. I have had many opportunities, as to men of an
<pb facs="tcp:105665:12"/> 
               <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Judgment, to do them <hi>ſignal Kindneſſes</hi> or <hi>Injuries;</hi> of the former I did many, of the latter none, to any one Learned and Sober Man. I always thought <hi>England</hi> was ſhort enough of them for its Miniſterial Uſes, ſo as we ſhould not make a <hi>particular Perſuaſion</hi> an occaſion to render them uſeleſs. In the late Times I conſtantly pleaded the cauſe of any Miniſter in queſtion, if he were queſtion'd only for uſing the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> not for any <hi>fundamental Error,</hi> nor for any <hi>Debauchery</hi> in his Life. I muſt confeſs I always thought a <hi>Sottiſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> was the vileſt of men, and never had an heart to plead one of their Cauſes, though I think there is not one of them can ſay I did them further <hi>injury,</hi> than by leaving them to plead for themſelves. This freedom of <hi>Converſe</hi> I kept till His <hi>Majeſties Reſtauration,</hi> and ſeveral Years after, until I ſaw that ſome (as I judged at leaſt) ſhunned my Company, and I never yet wanted enough ſo far as to tempt me to be an <hi>Intruder</hi> upon any. How little I was concerned in any Publick Affairs will appear from this, That (if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member right) from 1646, when I entred the Miniſtry, till 1653, I never but once
<pb facs="tcp:105665:13"/> ſaw <hi>London,</hi> nor I think twice more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that and 1659. I much kept home, and could hardly be a month from my People, but my Conſcience was ready to ask me, in the words of <hi>Eliab, With whom haſt thou left thoſe few ſheep in thy truſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Upon the coming out of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Uniformity,</hi> I was concerned (with Two thouſand Miniſters more) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether no more were by it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of me, than I might without <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God do?</hi> I ſaw ſo many things made neceſſary to the keeping of my ſtation, that I ſuſpected what I found, and more too, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was by ſome <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived</hi> to throw out of the Publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry a ſort of men, and all of them who were poſſeſſed of my Principles in <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and though it would not do as to all, yet it did as to a very great part, even all thoſe who though they believed the ſame things with many that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in points of Doctrine, yet had ſome ſtricter Notions as to <hi>Worſhip.</hi> I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the more <hi>confirmed</hi> in this, from a <hi>Reverend Miniſter,</hi> (now I doubt not but with God, who lived and dyed a <hi>Conformiſt</hi>) who told me, that in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb facs="tcp:105665:13"/> with a Brother of his, a Member in that <hi>Parliament,</hi> and lamenting to him the Turning out of ſo many Miniſters, and putting ſo many terms upon Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as they could not but know would Turn out the greater part of Miniſters ſo and ſo principled as to <hi>Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. He told him, <hi>It was their deſign to do it.</hi> It is very like he did not ſpeak the Senſe of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> of which he was a Member, but of many he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs did; That for thoſe of <hi>Puritan</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, (as they call'd them) <hi>Jehu</hi> might ſlay ſuch as eſcaped the Sword of <hi>Hazael,</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> thoſe that did eſcape the Sword of <hi>Jehu.</hi> But when I came more narrowly to look into the Things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I diſcourſed with Divines (and thoſe who were moſt Learned) of the <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Perſuaſion,</hi> I offered my Arguments, heard their Anſwers; I read the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Books wrote on all ſides, but upon the whole judged, that o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> eight or nine things required, I could not judge three, or not above three, in any degree lawful. I reſolved to lay down my Publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; but being ſet apart to the Miniſtry, having ſolemmly promiſed not to take away my hand from that Plough, I could

               </gap> further than in <hi>Publick Temples,</hi> (places in Superiors diſpoſal.) Amongſt other things, I was then fully poſſeſt of the <hi>Unlawfulneſs of performing Miniſterial Acts in Prayer, by the preſcribed Forms of others.</hi> Three or four of thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, truly I think I may ſay all but one of them, were my Arguments 1662. and then freely diſcourſed with divers of my own Brethren, and ſeveral Learned men (ſome of whom are dead, ſome yet alive) at this time, and the Heads of them by me were drawn up in writing, and the moſt conſiderable Inlargements, as to the proof of them. From that time, till 1673, they lay by me; ſome little before that, all knew at what a rude rare all <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi> were treated in ſeveral Books, as the verieſt <hi>Dunces</hi> in the world, men that oppoſed themſelves to <hi>Authority</hi> meerly out of <hi>Stubbornneſs,</hi> judging the things <hi>lawful,</hi> being able to give no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for their <hi>Nonconformity,</hi> Men fit for <hi>Gallies, Priſons,</hi> &amp;c. This made me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view what I had Eleven Years before drawn up for my own private uſe, with ſome Additions, and particularly Anſwers to ſome Arguments which in that time I
<pb facs="tcp:105665:14"/> had met with, and Dr. <hi>Falkner</hi>'s Book coming at that time out, I could not baulk what he had ſaid. Whoſoever readeth what I wrote, will be my Compurgator, that I did not give any a Preſumption, that I thought my Cauſe weak, by any uncivil treating of the Doctor. I ſaw he was a man of ſome Learning, that he had read many Authors; nor had I ever heard an ill word of him as to Sobriety of Life, or <hi>Warping in Doctrine.</hi> I treated him with that <hi>Civility</hi> which I thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came me, meerly anſwering his pretended Reaſon and Arguments. I did indeed ſee, that the making good the <hi>Notion</hi> I was fully poſſeſs'd of, would make any further anſwer to his <hi>Libertas Eccleſiaſtica</hi> need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and am very much for the Rule of <hi>Fruſtra fit per plura,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But though I quickly concluded this <hi>ſinful to me,</hi> to perform my <hi>Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Acts in Prayer, by the preſcribed Forms of others,</hi> yet I never intended to trouble others with my <hi>Notion,</hi> till I was challenged to it, by the worlds being told, <hi>We had nothing to ſay for our ſelves.</hi> I never that I remember preached it in one Sermon, I never affirmed it <hi>ſinful for

This, Reader, is known, to as many as know me by any ocular obſervation of my Converſe.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Further than this, my Nature diſpoſeth me to ſuch a Benignity, as I am <hi>Enemy</hi> to none but ſuch as are open <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105665:15"/> to the Glory of God, or led by their <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>Paſſions</hi> to Acts diſturbing <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Societies.</hi> Upon the firſt account, I always thought <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> open <hi>Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> profeſſed publick <hi>Idolaters,</hi> were to be puniſhed by the <hi>Judge</hi> with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt puniſhments. <hi>Profane Swearers</hi> and <hi>Curſers,</hi> and <hi>Violation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> with proportionable puniſhments; and thoſe who detected ſuch, did a good action. Yet as to theſe, I never thought an <hi>Inquiſition</hi> might be ſet up, nor an Oath <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> adminiſtred, to make them to accuſe themſelves. Nor as to <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> did I ever think that the Magiſtrate ought to puniſh any thing but <hi>Open Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of it, or <hi>Seduction</hi> to it. Upon which account, until this late <hi>Plot</hi> convinced me, that nothing would ſerve the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> leſs than the whole Government; and that to get it, they thought <hi>Aſſaſſinations, Poyſoning, Lying, For ſwearing,</hi> any thing lawful, I never heard of a <hi>Papiſt</hi> puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, whom I did not pity. For the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I diſcerned God ſo great a Lover of <hi>Humane Society,</hi> that all the Precepts of the Second Table are apparently calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for the <hi>preſervation</hi> of it, as I could not but abhor thoſe who without a juſt
<pb facs="tcp:105665:16"/> and apparent cauſe, made any attempt upon the quiet of it. Upon this account, I never was a Companion of any of theſe, but in my heart abhorred them: But for <hi>Errors,</hi> which had nothing of theſe in them, I could always give an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to them, always judging that I was not <hi>Infallible;</hi> and there was the ſame diſtance from my Neighbor to me, as from me to him. Though I always thought, that a particular Church might, as to its own Communion, judge of ſuch perſons, yet I never thought the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate concern'd to <hi>burn Houſes,</hi> impriſon any, becauſe ſome <hi>Church-men</hi> made an Outcry againſt them as <hi>Hereticks, Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks;</hi> or that an whole City muſt be put into Arms, (as in <hi>Madrid</hi> and <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi>) becauſe there is a <hi>Cry made</hi> for the <hi>Holy Houſe.</hi> And amongſt all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Humane Society,</hi> and indeed <hi>Mankind,</hi> I always thought ſome of the <hi>worſt,</hi> and leaſt able to give account of their actions either to <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Men,</hi> who purſue others to any <hi>ſignal Suffering,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they differed from them in ſome Opinions, which could neither be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with <hi>Blaſphemy, Atheiſm, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> or any apparent <hi>prophanation of the

He will give but one inſtance, which he ſaith is in my 68, 69 pages, <hi>ſpeaking of the Original of Liturgies,</hi> I ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <q>We do believe, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, under the Protection of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, was the Father of all thoſe that dwell in theſe Tents, and that <hi>800</hi> or a <hi>1000</hi> years after Chriſt.</q> My words in that place are theſe,</p>
            <p>
               <q>To bring this point to an Iſſue, there was a Book publiſhed 1662, called, <hi>A ſober and temperate Diſcourſe concerning the Intereſt of words in Prayer.</hi> The <hi>Reader</hi> may there at large ſee what we judg con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Original of Liturgies,</hi> when our <hi>Reverend Brother,</hi> or any for him, ſhall have given a <hi>ſtrict Reply</hi> to the 3. and 4. <hi>Chapters</hi> in that Book, we ſhall think they have more to ſay for their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, then we have yet ſeen. In the mean time we do believe that <hi>Gregory the Great</hi> (uſually ſaid to be the worſt of all Popes that went before him) under the <hi>Protection</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great was the Father of all thoſe who dwell in theſe Tents, and that 800 or 1000 years after Chriſt.</q> He leaves out the firſt part, and the reference to the other Book.</p>
            <p>The truth is, it was too <hi>Elliptically</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, towards a Perſon that ſought an
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105665:26"/> occaſion to <hi>Carp</hi> and <hi>Reflect;</hi> which that our <hi>Vindicator</hi> did too much appears from his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of what was p. 68, 69. of a book which had not above 180. pages in it, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. In the 4 p. of his Anſwer, and then again in p. 138. of his Anſwer, in both which places, he makes ſport with it, at ſuch a rate as were unpardonable, but that it was juſt about <hi>Prevarication</hi> time at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was a thing fitter to make ſport for boys then men, who underſtand any thing of Senſe, and have any judgment.</p>
            <p n="10">10. He comes upon it with a <hi>Firſtly, Secondly, Thirdly,</hi> then makes Application ſuitably, which he purſueth p. 138. and amplifies with a <hi>Rabbinical Story,</hi> and ſhuts up his <hi>Reflection</hi> with a very pretty <hi>Jeſt.</hi> His words are theſe,</p>
            <p>
               <q>To ſpeak of <hi>Gregory the great</hi> 800 or 1000 years after Chriſt, is far enough from truth, when he dyed about the year 1604; and Secondly that <hi>Gregory the great</hi> ſhould be under the Protection of <hi>Charles the great,</hi> is impoſſible, when he was dead about 200 years before <hi>Charles the great</hi> began his Reign. And 3ly. It is altogether as inaccountable that <hi>Liturgies</hi> had their <hi>Original,</hi> either in the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> or <hi>Charles the great,</hi> when they were in uſe many 100 years before them both, <hi>Quod eſt demonſtrandum.</hi> Then he comes to Application. This miſtake concerning theſe Perſons, whoſe Names are ſo famous in Hiſtory, that a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105665:26"/> Man of ordinary reading could not be unacquainted with them, is, as if any perſon ſhould preſume to give account of the Church of the Iſraelites and ſhould aſſert that the offering of Sacrifices under the Moſaicai Law, had its beginning in the days of <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt, in the Reign of K. <hi>Jehoſophat,</hi> 600 or 800 years after the Iſraelites came out of <hi>Egypt. This is a great piece of ignorance and error: That's the firſt uſe.</hi> Surely it is a ſtrange confidence for any perſon to vent ſuch things and to write poſitively what he no better underſtandeth.</q> 
               <hi>The Author therefore of the Reaſonable Account, is an ignorant confident perſon.</hi> That is the 2d. uſe, p. 138. <q>Therefore <hi>we muſt not reaſonably expect any accuracy in the right</hi> computation of the time of the birth and firſt production of Liturgies from him who talks ſo looſly and falſly, about the Age in which <hi>Gregory</hi> the great lived; whom he would make the Father of them.</q> 
               <hi>Therefore Sirs you are not to believe any thing this Author ſaith on this Argument. That is the</hi> 3d, <hi>and main uſe.</hi> 
               <q>And it is ſpeaking enough at random, to fix their Original now at 600 after at 800, then at a 10000 years after Chriſt; <hi>for the Author contradicts himſelf, and cannot tell whether it was at</hi> 6 <hi>or</hi> 800, <hi>or</hi> 1000 <hi>years after Chriſt</hi> (that is the Engliſh of this, and inforceth the laſt branch of Application) I ſhall repeat our <hi>Vindicators</hi> words no
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105665:27"/> further, let him pleaſe himſelf and ſuch <hi>Readers</hi> (as ſuch trifles will pleaſe) with his <hi>Rabbinical Tradition</hi> about <hi>Phinehas,</hi> and his fancy (to reconcile my words to truth) that <hi>Gregory</hi> might live 400 years, and then have need of <hi>Charles</hi> the great to govern him in his dottage: I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile what I ſaid, to truth and ſenſe, at a more intelligible rate.</q>

In the firſt place every Scholar knows, that in matters of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology; it is our Cuſtom to conſult ſome <hi>Chronologer</hi> or other <hi>Pro re nata,</hi> and that it is no piece of Learning to carry in Memory the Years of Mens Births or Deaths (Reaſon being not at all concerned in the caſe) but when we have occaſion to take notice of any ſuch thing, we uſe to look into them; and Dr. <hi>Cave</hi>'s Tables are continually in mine eye while I am in my Study, and <hi>Helvicus</hi> within a reach; the one of which preſently telleth me <hi>Gregory</hi> the greats time, and the other <hi>Charles</hi> the greats; ſo as the <hi>Vindicator</hi> hath not ſhewn much of his own <hi>Judgment</hi> or <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> in making one ſo mightily <hi>defective in learning,</hi> meerly for miſtaking the time of a <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Emperors</hi> Reign: and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident as himſelf is that <hi>Gregory</hi> dyed 604,</p>
            <p>I am ſure <hi>Platina</hi> ſaith, he entred his <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> 610, which (according to our <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> (who is ſo ſevere a Critick in Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology) was ſix years after he was dead;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105665:27"/> which would make a better Argument than any of the Papiſts have, to prove <hi>Gregory a moſt Holy Father,</hi> having ſpent ſix years in Heaven, and received a better <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation</hi> than the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could give him, and then came down (not without Gods leave ſure, to be his Sons <hi>Vicar,</hi> and to rule his Church on Earth. Now who ſo conſiders, that <hi>Platina</hi> was a later <hi>Popes Secretary,</hi> and ſo had doubtleſs the command of their <hi>Archives,</hi> and <hi>Abbreviator Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus;</hi> ſo as it was his buſineſs to ſearch into the things of that Church, may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably think he much better knew than our <hi>Vindicator</hi> could, his Chronology, yea, or than any other <hi>Monk,</hi> or more ordinary <hi>Religioſo;</hi> and to correct <hi>Platina</hi> by any of them, is much like ſetting the Sun by ones Watch. <hi>Qui alterum incuſat probri ipſum ſe intueri oportet.</hi> If any one object that my ſelf ſays, <hi>Gregory</hi> was not Pope till about 600 (as I believe I have ſaid more than once in this Diſcourſe) or that he lived <hi>Anno</hi> 600, every one will underſtand me as expreſſing <hi>Numerum Rotundum,</hi> the number of the age only, not the particular year; and that my meaning was at the cloſe of the 6th, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 7th Age; but if one will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the very year of his death, and ſay he died 604, he is tied to more exactneſs, for fear a Reſurrection be proved upon the Aſſertor, admitting his Aſſertion.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But this being premiſed, let us more ſtrictly inquire, Whether there was ſuch a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105665:28"/> miſtake or no? In very deed there was none' and all this noiſe is cauſed from our <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicators</hi> applying that to perſons which I never intended but of the <hi>practice</hi> and <hi>uſage;</hi> for what elſe could I underſtand by <hi>the Father of all theſe that dwell in theſe Tents?</hi> but the Father of thoſe who have introduced into the Church, the general uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Forms of Prayers to be uſed by all Miniſters, in their Publick Solemn Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?</p>
            <p>I ſaid and I ſay it again, That <hi>Gregory the Great</hi> was the Father of theſe men; he firſt made a <hi>Canon</hi> in the caſe. I mean a Rule or Decree; I think <hi>Durandus</hi> or <hi>Platina,</hi> uſe the term <hi>Redegit in Canonem.</hi> This Canon was charged but with Powder, and did no great execution, till <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> near 200 years after that, added a Bullet to <hi>Gregorys</hi> Powder; this did great <hi>Execution,</hi> for he enforced all men with <hi>Fire and Sword;</hi> and this I think was a great protection of <hi>Gregory the Greats Canonical</hi> Sanction. <hi>Charles</hi> his Empire was large, and we muſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that a year or two, or twenty, would not perfect ſo great an alteration, no not in the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> (which was not all the Chriſtian World) ſo as I do think that it is no large conjecture, to gueſs it might be 1000 years before this practice got any general uſage. This <hi>Cubb</hi> was whelped by <hi>Gregory the Great,</hi> but all his Authority and <hi>Canons,</hi> &amp;c. could not lick it into a juſt form, till <hi>Charles the Great</hi> put his Mouth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105665:28"/> to it, and his Hand and Sword alſo; which muſt be in the Ninth Century, and cannot well be imagined to have been perfected in a ſmall time. I believe when I come to our <hi>Vindicators</hi> p 156, 157. I ſhall find (if not a deſigned Cheat) a groſſer Error in Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology than this amounts to; for this indeed is none. The <hi>Vindicator</hi> might have ſeen in the Book to which I referred in that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, that I did know, or might have read there (and I will aſſure him I read it once or twice) what time <hi>Gregory the Great</hi> lived, and at what diſtance from <hi>Charles the Great.</hi> And the World may ſee by a <hi>Supplement to the Reaſonable Account,</hi> which came out the very ſame week with this <hi>Vindication of Liturgies,</hi> and is wholly about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Antiquity of Liturgies;</hi> that I was not ignorant of this abſtruſe and mighty piece of Learning, and needed not his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in it.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Our <hi>Vindicator</hi> in the next place (<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trod.</hi> p. 5.) declareth againſt his meddling with any part of the <hi>Reaſonable Account,</hi> wherein I anſwered others, which I am well content with, and ſhall likewiſe deſire my <hi>Reader,</hi> not to expect I ſhould ſtrictly follow him in his large <hi>Digreſſions,</hi> wherein he ſpeaketh nothing to my <hi>Arguments.</hi> But he further tells us, <q>That he ſhall wave the Repetition of my long Syllogiſms, which is a tedious way of proceeding, and in rational diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of this nature is acceptable to few others, than thoſe who may admire the Art of making a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105665:29"/> Syllogiſm; but I ſhall give a faithful account of the ſubſtance of his Arguments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. I muſt confeſs I never thought it much material, whether a <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> were in <hi>Ceſare,</hi> or <hi>Darapte,</hi> or <hi>Jeriſon,</hi> nor thought it worth the while to diſpute the myſteries of the ſtructure of a <hi>Syllogiſm;</hi> but I am to learn that a <hi>Syllogiſtical</hi> diſputing is more tedious than that more ungirt way, which it ſeems pleaſeth our Author better. A <hi>Proſyllogiſm</hi> I always thought very proper, and I have troubled him with no more in any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But <hi>Latet anguis in herba</hi> (I fear) had our <hi>Vindicator</hi> tied up himſelf to <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſms,</hi> he would hardly have been able to have crouded in this momentous Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion — <hi>The Author of the Reaſonable Account, did not know</hi> what time <hi>Gregory the Great</hi> or <hi>Charles the Great lived.</hi> Nor got in this concluſion. <hi>Ergo,</hi> He was an <hi>ignorant man, defective in learning, very confident, from whom no accuracy is to be expected.</hi> But let him run his looſer method (for certainly Logick and Syllogiſtical arguing, is the <hi>Palma con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracta</hi>) if he ſo diſcourſeth that I can but underſtand, whether he denys the <hi>Major</hi> or the <hi>Minor,</hi> or the <hi>Concluſion</hi> onely, it ſhall be enough for my purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="15">15. For what follows, I have ſaid enough before to excuſe me from any imputation; as to the time of my Book coming out, which was in 1679, about <hi>Mich.</hi> it was printed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea ſix moneths before; I had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in it, nor ſeen it ſince <hi>April</hi> 1677, when I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105665:29"/> gave it to a friend, who begg'd it of me.</p>
            <p>But ſo various are our Apprehenſions, that my opinion is, it could never have come out in a more <hi>ſeaſonable time;</hi> when it is in the heart of our <hi>Rulers</hi> to unite all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which I am ſure cannot be, while the <hi>Impoſition of Forms of Prayer on all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> in their <hi>publick Miniſterial Service</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> holds. But may eaſily be, by leaving <hi>ſuch Forms to liberty.</hi> I do very well know what a <hi>clamour ſome make</hi> for <hi>Impoſed Forms;</hi> and therefore think it is highly neceſſary we ſhould tell them why we judge them (as to our practice) unlawful, that our <hi>Rulers</hi> and People may judge, whether we be ſuch <hi>illiterate, nonſenſical, irrational,</hi> perſons, ſuch <hi>ſtrange undertakers,</hi> and meer <hi>confident</hi> men, as we are repreſented to the World to be: Or whether theſe Clamours be meerly <hi>Crys</hi> of <hi>Intereſt,</hi> like that of old, <hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Epheſians. So I have done with our <hi>Vindicators</hi> Introduction. Only deſiring my <hi>Reader</hi> may know that I am not arguing <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> (now moſt <hi>generally uſed</hi> and <hi>impoſed</hi>) unlawful; but <hi>juſtifying</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which I have formerly given, <hi>why we cannot judge them, as to our practice, lawful,</hi> let them be in themſelves what they ſhall be evinced to be. If our <hi>Vindicator</hi> can quit himſelf of the Arguments I have brought, I I have no more at preſent to ſay.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>An Anſwer to the <hi>Vindicators</hi> Firſt <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> concerning the ſtating of the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I Am beholden to the Learned <hi>Author,</hi> for allowing me, or any <hi>Noncon.</hi> an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to ſtate a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> with <hi>ſufficient plainneſs and clearneſs;</hi> and ſhall requite him, owning that he hath truly repeated my ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it (a favour not ordinary in this age.) But his Obſervations deduced from my Conceſſions, muſt not paſs wholly unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That our Prayers muſt be <hi>directed to God</hi> (as he obſerveth) needed not the atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of two of the Fathers. 2. That our <hi>general wants</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Pardon, Sanctification, Daily Bread,</hi> &amp;c. I like not ſo well to ſay all our <hi>ordinary wants</hi>) may be expreſſed in <hi>Forms,</hi> I doubt not. Nor 3. <hi>That a pious Soul, not able to pray from his own Gifts, may truly</hi> worſhip God <hi>mentally,</hi> by reading a Form, I doubt not; but to make this <hi>true external worſhip,</hi> I think will be required a command from God. It is alſo true, that one difference betwixt <hi>Praying with</hi> and <hi>without a Form,</hi> is that in <hi>the former way, the ſame words and methods are conſtantly uſed, in the other not ſo.</hi> But if by praying we
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105665:30"/> mean the <hi>Action of a Man,</hi> the main diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence contended for, is, <hi>That he that prayeth in the uſe of his Gitfs, doth the will of God; whether the other doth ſo, is the very Queſtion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And ſo indeed the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> tells us, only repreſents it ſomething too invidiouſly; for no man ſaith, <hi>That God is pleaſed with our varying of phraſes,</hi> or <hi>altering our methods;</hi> but we are ſure God is pleaſed <hi>with our doing of his will,</hi> in as little things as thoſe are. It certainly had been vain Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy under the <hi>Jewiſh Paedagogy,</hi> to have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued that it was not probable that God ſaw any <hi>beauty</hi> or <hi>valuableneſs</hi> in the <hi>killing</hi> of <hi>a Beaſt,</hi> for he was a Spirit, and true Goodneſs, Piety, and Sincerity are the things which he delighted in. Who knows not all this? But he is pleaſed in <hi>obeying his will in the leaſt things.</hi> The Queſtion therefore is, <hi>What is Gods Will in the caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>obey God</hi> is certainly <hi>better than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> and needs muſt be, becauſe all the value of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> lay in the <hi>obedience</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it. <hi>If it be the will of God that his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould ſerve him in the uſe of their own Gifts</hi> (from whence muſt neceſſarily follow the <hi>altering of Phraſes and Methods</hi>) though there be no <hi>intrinſick value</hi> in theſe things, yet they are better then all other <hi>Sacrifices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But our <hi>Author</hi> thinketh not this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. And why? 1. <hi>Becauſe our Saviour rebuked the vanity of them, who think they ſhall be heard by their much ſpeaking; Mat.</hi> 6.7. <hi>And as a Remedy, taught his Diſciples that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105665:31"/> Form of Prayer. Auſtine</hi> from hence judged <hi>ſuperfluity of words</hi> needleſs;<note place="margin">What he ſaith as to the Lords Prayer, is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſpoken to.</note> ſo did <hi>Hilary;</hi> and it is a piece of <hi>Reverence</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by <hi>Solomon Eccl.</hi> 5.2.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But what is all this but a waſting of <hi>Ink and Paper?</hi> May not then a Miniſter pray in the uſe of his own Gifts, unleſs he prayeth to an <hi>unreaſonable length?</hi> Muſt he needs uſe a <hi>ſuperfluity of words,</hi> or a <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of words,</hi> becauſe he doth not uſe thoſe words others have prepared for him? Who ſeeth not theſe inconſequences?</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the next place, p. 14. he argues, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe under the Law God did not require daily various changes of the real expreſſions of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip and Service, but appointed them to be continually the ſame;</hi> Num. 28, 2, 3. <hi>which maketh it more than probable that the variety of verbal expreſſions is not requiſite to obtain his acceptance under the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not wonder that our <hi>Author</hi> at firſt (though of Learning enough to make them, and anſwer Arguments in that Form) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his diſlike of the uſe of Sylogiſms; for if ſuch Arguments as this be put into thoſe Forms, they would be too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Is there the ſame reaſon for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God <hi>under the Goſpel,</hi> as under the Law? becauſe <hi>Typical Services</hi> prefiguring <hi>one Chriſt,</hi> were <hi>invariable;</hi> muſt therefore <hi>Spiritual Services under the Goſpel</hi> be ſo too? conſider then why the Miniſter doth not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105665:31"/> always preach the <hi>ſame Sermons,</hi> becauſe the Jews were to offer <hi>Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifices,</hi> and we <hi>under the Goſpel</hi> are alſo bound to pray in all parts of time; muſt therefore the Will of God be that in all things elſe they ſhould agree? Is there the ſame reaſon for the performance of <hi>Acts of Worſhip,</hi> after the <hi>plentiful effuſion of the Spirit</hi> in the days of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> as before? Nay, is our Author ſure, that in the <hi>Jewiſh Worſhip</hi> they all uſed the ſame <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Exhortations,</hi> becauſe they always <hi>killed</hi> the <hi>ſame ſpecifical Beaſts</hi> for <hi>Sacrifices?</hi> In their very Sacrifices there was a great <hi>variety,</hi> and they agreed in nothing, but that they all were what <hi>God preſcribed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. What he ſaith in p. 15. is granted him, nothing but the <hi>will of God</hi> is worth naming in the cauſe, words in themſelves are nor valuable, but <hi>obedience</hi> is. What makes then this trifling about the Opinions of Heathens, the invaluableneſs of words in themſelves, the way of Worſhip under the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What is all this to any purpoſe, but to prepoſſeſs the unwary <hi>Reader?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. His next obſervation is, That the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth not account himſelf certain of the truth of this Poſition.</hi> What doth he mean by certain? The <hi>Author</hi> is none of the <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libles</hi> of our Age, and hath more modeſty than to dictate to all the World, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> of a thing that it may be is not capable of it: But he is <hi>morally certain,</hi> certain, as far as <hi>probable Arguments</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:105665:32"/> can <hi>make him.</hi> But what then? Therefore <hi>it appears not to him unlawful?</hi> Will any weighed Divine in the World ſay. That a thing is not unlawful to him, that upon Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which to him appeareth highly probable, appears unlawful? Let the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> anſwer a Book called, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, wrote on this very Argument.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The <hi>Author</hi> values not a ruſh, whether the Anſwerer blames, or not blames him, for the thing, ſome perſons in this Age calls <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</hi> He falls not by Mans Judgment. There was in <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> which <hi>Luther</hi> gloryed in; and there is a <hi>Separation</hi> which a good Chriſtian may glory in; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. The Queſtion is, Whether the <hi>Nonconf. be guilty of a ſinful Separation?</hi> That <hi>Nonconf.</hi> are guilty of that, here is no Argument to prove; but the <hi>Author accounting himſelf certain,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned p. 21. which is a new <hi>Topick;</hi> for I hope it is no <hi>Demonſtration.</hi>

               <p n="10">10. The <hi>Vindicator,</hi> p. 22. in the next place, comes to tell us of <hi>conſiderable prejudices</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth of my Aſſertion. 1. <hi>That it is againſt the Opinion of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and the moſt famous Churches in the Primitive times.</hi> But to the latter part of this he very honeſtly adds — a <hi>Quod eſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrandum;</hi> referring it to be afterwards proved.

                  <q>An impoſed Liturgy, unleſs in a particular Province, for a time, in a particular caſe, ſuch as was that of the ſpreading of Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, we can not find.

               </p>
               <p>It is true which I alſo ſaid, <hi>That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Liturgyes, owes it ſelf, in a great meaſure, to Churches not having Men enough able pray without Forms.</hi> But what is this to the purpoſe of Univerſally Impoſed Liturgies?

               <p n="3">3. The firſt Argument was ſtated thus.</p>
               <q>To omit a mean for the performance of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Act given us by God for the performance of it, and being natural, and proper,<note place="margin">Reaſonable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. p. 5.</note> at the command of man, when we perform that Religious Act, is ſinful.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>But for a Miniſter, having the Gift of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ordinarily to perform his Miniſterial Act in Prayer, by reading or reciting Forms of Prayers compoſed by others (confeſſedly not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpired) is for him to omit, a natural and proper mean given him by God, in order to the performance of ſuch Religious Act, and in the Omiſſion of it to perform ſuch Religious Act.</hi> Ergo,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major Propoſition</hi> ſhineth ſo much in its own light, that it was not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but by affirming, <hi>That it is lawful for us at the command of Men, in an Act of Gods W rſhip to omit a mean given us of God for that end, and to perform that Act in the uſe of other means, under no ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecial preſcription from God;</hi> which is to ſay, it is lawful to allow Men to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e wiſer then God in directing the means of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; which certainly is a ſtrange poſition.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:105665:37"/>4. Yet our Anſwerer, tho he will not in plain terms deny the <hi>Major,</hi> p. 57. tells us, <hi>That a mean given us of God, if it be only capable of being uſed, and not a neceſſary mean to be uſed, may lawfully be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, eſpecially when there are ſeveral means.</hi> What doth he mean by <hi>ſeveral means?</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral means given by God for that end, that are <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Proper,</hi> then it is moſt true. But it lieth upon him to prove that <hi>God hath in this caſe preſcribed ſeveral means.</hi> But if he means ſeveral <hi>Humane means</hi> under no Divine Preſcription, it amounteth to no leſs then I ſaid before, the praeference of the Wiſdom of Men to the Wiſdom of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What doth he mean by telling us, <hi>A Divine mean may be omitted, if it be not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be uſed,</hi> when the very drift of the <hi>Argument</hi> is to prove, <hi>That it is neceſſary to be uſed,</hi> becauſe it is a <hi>Divine Mean,</hi> and there is no other can lay claim to that <hi>Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> nor can be ſo <hi>Natural,</hi> nor is ſo <hi>Proper.</hi> Now this quite ſpoiles the retorting the Argument.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But altho our Anſwerer thinks fit to nibble a little about the <hi>Major,</hi> yet plainly diſcerning, that was not to be denied by any Perſon of his Reputation in the World, his whole force is ſpent about the <hi>Minor Propoſition,</hi> as to which he ſaith much; which himſelf ſummeth up, p. 57.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> That an ability fitly to expreſs our mind to God in Prayer, is not the gift of Prayer

                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> That it is neither a duty nor yet expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that ſuch abilities ſhould be uſed and conſtantly uſed, any further then is agreeable to the Rules of Edification and Order.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="7">7. Whatſoever our <hi>Anſwerer</hi> ſaith upon the firſt head (which is very much, one while confounding the <hi>Gift of prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Grace of Prayer,</hi> as one and the ſame thing; another while telling us of an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Gift of Prayer</hi>) is ſo much from the purpoſe, that our <hi>Author</hi> owns it as a digreſſion <hi>p.</hi> 28. So as I am not concerned in any thing of that diſcourſe further then to mend a Term in my <hi>Minor,</hi> and make it to run thus:
<q>But for a Miniſter having an Ability fitly to expreſs his mind to God in Prayer, to perform his Miniſterial Acts in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ordinarily by reading or reciting <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was there any need at all thus to mend it, but to ſave my ſelf trouble of a <hi>Word-bait.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8.

               <p n="10">10.

               <p n="11">11. But ſaith our Author <hi>p.</hi> 29. That is eminently and eſpecially to be eſteemed the <hi>Gift of Prayer, which diſpoſeth and ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth to the performance of the duty of Prayer</hi> (very true,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> p. 29.</note> and is not this all I have contended for?) <hi>And therefore ſince Prayer is not ſo much a verbal thing, as a pious addreſs of the Heart, Soul, and Spirit to God, the Supplies and Aſſiſtances of his Grace which kindle and excite pious Diſpoſitions, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God, with earneſt and affectionate deſires, a lively Faith, and the exerciſe of inward Devotion; this is moſt properly his vouchſafing and beſtowing the Gift of Prayer; and our having and exerciſing them, is our having and uſing the Gift of Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This now is well ſaid as to <hi>Truth,</hi> but not a tittle of it to the purpoſe: Here is a manifeſt <hi>Tranſition,</hi> from <hi>one kind to another.</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:105665:39"/> That a Chriſtian may in his heart Pray, tho his Lips move not, is out of doubt (Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah did ſo.) But can any Miniſter diſcharge his Miniſterial Duty in Publick Prayer thus? Nay can a private Chriſtian in his Family, or Cloſet do it? If not, there is another kind of <hi>Prayer</hi> beſides this, and our Author knew well enough, that it is that we are ſpeaking of. The Queſtion is, What is the <hi>Gift of Prayer</hi> relating to <hi>Vocal Prayer?</hi> Our <hi>Anſwerer</hi> grants, It is that which <hi>inableth and diſpoſeth to the performance of the duty.</hi> Now I appeal again to any one that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth ſenſe, Whether thoſe things which the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> mentions, inable any perſon to <hi>Vocal Prayer,</hi> as it ſtands contradiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>meer heart Prayer,</hi> which is that we are not at all ſpeaking of? It is manifeſt it is not, for then <hi>no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever, no Wicked Man, hath any Ability to pray,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> had given very impertinent Counſel to the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer to Pray, that <hi>the thoughts of his heart might be forgiven him;</hi> which it ſeems he had no Gift, no Ability to do; for it is certain he had <hi>no Faith, nor Pious Affections.</hi> It might have been expected, that he who Faults others for Impropriety of Speech, ſhould himſelf have ſpoken <hi>Ad idem</hi> at leaſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the thing in Queſtion, which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath done, or no, I leave to any one who underſtands ſenſe to judge. The Author of the Book he anſwereth, had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten enough told him, that he ſpake not concerning <hi>Heart Prayer</hi> but <hi>Vocal Prayer,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:105665:39"/> that Praying wherein in obedience to the command of God, the <hi>voice is uſed,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the <hi>deſires of the heart.</hi> It is an eaſie thing to anſwer at this rate.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For what he ſaith p. 31, 32, 33. in Anſwer to what the Author had ſpoken from <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. to prove a <hi>Gift of Prayer</hi> to be a <hi>Divine Gift,</hi> iſſueth in this, Whether by the <hi>Spirit of Grace and Supplication,</hi> and the <hi>Spirits helping our Infirmity in Pra er,</hi> be to be underſtood, as well the <hi>Spirits giving us an Ability fitly to expreſs our minds to God in Prayer,</hi> as fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing us with <hi>Gracious Habits, diſpoſing us ſo to Pray as we may find favour with God.</hi> It is our Anſwerers concern to affirm the latter onely: But the <hi>Author</hi> is of another mind; becauſe he finds in Scripture, Gifts that are not ſaving, called <hi>Spiritual Gifts;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1. and the <hi>Manifeſtations of the Spirit;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. where are reckoned the <hi>Word of Wiſdom,</hi> the <hi>Word of Knowledg,</hi> the <hi>Gifts of Healing, Working of Miracles, Prophecy, Tongues;</hi> ſome of which are by the ſame Apoſtle determined no <hi>ſaving gifts;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2, 3. The <hi>Author</hi> is of the mind that all theſe are comprehended under the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of <hi>powring out of the Spirit,</hi> mentioned in the Old <hi>Teſtament,</hi> And tho an Ability to Pray be not mentioned in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. yet he never thought to have met with any who regarded what he ſaid, who would have denied, <hi>That it is a gift, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105665:40"/> a Spiritual gift;</hi> nor doth yet believe it ſhut out of thoſe Promiſes, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Rom</hi> 8.26. tho not ſolely, perhaps not Principally intended in them: both which, the Author grants to the <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> if he can make any Market with them.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Our Anſwerer is again at it p 34. <hi>As that Ability of Expreſſion whereby a Man largely profeſſeth the particular Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith, is not properly the Gift of Faith, of Believing, ſo neither is the like Ability of expreſſing the matter of our Prayer to be accounted</hi> in any proper <hi>ſenſe the Gift of Prayer.</hi> Still we are upon the old fallacy, and whatſoever I Anſwer, our <hi>Anſwerer</hi> will avoid us, by telling us he ſpake of meer <hi>Heart Pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105665:46"/> being now part of an <hi>Act,</hi> many think it ſhould have been by the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> all read over thrice) and when it was read over in the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> what a miſtake was found in it by their <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> will ſee no reaſon to <hi>preſume,</hi> that it was by our <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Superiours</hi> (who yet without a <hi>Parliament,</hi> are not our Superiours, in the point of Legal Eſtabliſhments) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed</hi> with the <hi>greateſt Care and Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 2. If it were ſo, ſurely the <hi>Nonconfor niſts</hi>-Adverſaries, would not all this time have only contended that there were no Phraſes in it but might <hi>Lawfully</hi> be uſed, but they would have pleaded, <hi>That there could no better Forms be compoſed, or uſed;</hi> which I do not know that any of them hath gone about to demonſtrate. What in a <hi>Legal Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment,</hi> is not once reviewed, by one part of the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> power in any place, cannot certainly be ſaid to be <hi>reviewed,</hi> with the greateſt <hi>Conſideration,</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> tho poſſibly it might be by ſome ſaid to be reviewed with a <hi>ſufficient Conſideration;</hi> as to which I ſay nothing, but cannot allow <hi>Superlatives</hi> in the caſe. 3. This very Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will conclude for <hi>Forms of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> every whit as much as for Forms of Prayer. But I ſhall give a ſtrict Anſwer to it.</p>

               <p n="28">He goes on: <q>And he who talketh
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105665:48"/> of this our Church, That if all her Miniſters cannot conſtantly in their daily Prayers equal or outdo the perfection or exactneſs of a well conſidered Form (for this muſt be his Senſe, if he ſpeaketh to any purpoſe) that this may be ſpoken to the ſhame of the Church of God in <hi>England:</hi> Theſe raw and extravagant ſpeeches will be to the ſhame of thoſe that utter them, ſo far as they will be aſhamed of uncharitable and reproachful calumnies againſt the Church of God, and of ſpeaking againſt all Senſe and Reaſon.</q>

               <p>When I read this, I wondered who he meant, till I ſaw in the <hi>Margent</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> quoted which he pretends to anſwer, p. 157. there I find in anſwer to the Vindicators arguing the <hi>Neceſſity of Liturgyes,</hi> 
                  <q>That needful <hi>and</hi> comprehenſive Petitions for all Common and Ordinary, Spiritual and outward wants, of our ſelves and others, with fit Thanksgivings; may not in the publick Supplications of the Church be omitted; which conſidering men as they are, can no other way be ſo well or at all aſſured.</q> That the Author of that Book had ſaid,</p>

                  <q>Let it be ſpoken to the ſhame of the Church of God in <hi>England,</hi> and it ſhall be for a Lamentation in it, if in a Church (whoſe Territories are ſo large) there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found perſons enough ſufficient without others preſcriptions to them, to put up needful comprehenſive Petitions, not only for common and ordinary, but for the Emergent and Extraordinary Spiritual and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105665:48"/> outward wants of any perſons with fit thankſgivings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What makes the man in ſuch a paſſion for this?— Here is not a wotd of <hi>all Miniſters being able to equal and out do the Perfection and Exactneſs of a well conſidered Form,</hi> (but this he ſaith, muſt be his ſenſe, or he ſpeaks to no purpoſe) <hi>E Cathedra dictum.</hi>

               <p n="29">29. All this while it ſeems the <hi>Vindicator</hi> hath ſaid nothing to the <hi>Authors Argument.</hi> The great thing which ſeems to be the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt us in all this Diſcourſe, is, <hi>Whether

               <p n="30">30. The ſecond thing, he ſaith is p. 58. <q>That Ability of Expreſſion is not peculiarly and particularly given by God to M niſters, that they might thereby perform the publick Office of Prayer.</q> This he would prove, <hi>Becauſe it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to others beſide Miniſters — Becauſe then our Lord would not have given his Diſciples a Form of Prayer:</hi> — But is this the Queſtion? I aſſume no more, then that it is <hi>a Mean given by God in order to the performance of the act, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and proper.</hi> What if it be given to others as well as Miniſters? then they are alſo bound to perform the <hi>Act</hi> in the <hi>uſe</hi> of it: The giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it to others as well as Miniſters, ſurely doth not make it ceaſe to be a <hi>Gift,</hi> a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Gift,</hi> a <hi>Gift</hi> in <hi>order</hi> to the <hi>Act;</hi> which is all I have ſaid. And <hi>Dato non conceſſo,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing our Saviour did give his Diſciples the

                  <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> for a <hi>Form of words,</hi> doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this is not a <hi>Divine Mean natural</hi> and <hi>proper,</hi> becauſe that (altho not ſo Natural) yet it is as <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Proper,</hi> being appointed by him who is <hi>God over all, bleſſed for ever;</hi> or that becauſe we may doubtleſs uſe any Mean of <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> therefore we may <hi>neglect a Mean</hi> given us of God, and uſe a Mean under no <hi>Divine Preſcription?</hi> Certainly it will not follow, that becauſe a <hi>Form</hi> Compoſed, and Inſtituted by Chriſt, is a <hi>Divine Mean,</hi> therefore <hi>Forms Inſtituted by men,</hi> are; till Chriſts Commiſſion to them to do as much in his Church in this caſe as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, be well proved. I leave this Anſwer to any fair intelligent <hi>Reader</hi>'s Judgment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be adequate or no?</p>
               <p n="31">31. In the next place he tells us the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of <hi>Governours is of conſiderable weight:</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is, but not in this caſe, becauſe it cannot be pleaded without <hi>begging the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on,</hi> as may be ſeen by the <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>plain</hi> ſtating of it p. 5. and certainly, the anſwering of an Argument by a plain and open begging the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> ſpeaks the <hi>Vindicator</hi> to be as <hi>Defective</hi> in his <hi>Logick,</hi> as the <hi>Author</hi> was ſuppoſed to be in his <hi>Chronological learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="32">32. He tells us p. 60. That the Author ſaith, <hi>That a mans own Gift and Ability is a Divine Mean.</hi> He doth ſo, and it is true. <hi>But a Form of Prayer is a meer humane Mean.</hi> A Form of Prayer preſcribed or compoſed by others, to be uſed by me, if thoſe others were
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105665:50"/> not authorized by God, is but an <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Mean;</hi> nor is it poſſible that it ſhould be other.— Now (he ſaith) <q>this muſt be upon a Suppoſition that an ability to compoſe a Prayer, to ſpeak it, is a Divine Ability; (<hi>he ſhould have ſaid</hi> Mean) but the ſame ability, to compoſe the ſame Prayer if it be written, is a meer Humane Mean (<hi>for ſo he ſhould have ſaid if he intended to ſpeak Senſe, as every</hi> Reader <hi>will own.</hi>
                  </q>) An Ability to expreſs our minds fitly in Prayer to God, is a <hi>Divine Mean</hi> relating to the Action of Praying. An <hi>Ability fitly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the matter or ſtile of a Prayer in a Book,</hi> is alſo a <hi>Divine Mean, in order to the action of writing ſuch a Form.</hi> But how doth it appear that another Mans Ability, fitly to expreſs the matter or ſtile of a Prayer in a Book, is alſo a <hi>Divine Mean</hi> in order to my <hi>Action in Prayer?</hi> He that can prove this, muſt uſe another <hi>Medium,</hi> or elſe aſſert, That what is a Divine Mean for <hi>A. B.</hi> as to one <hi>Action,</hi> is alſo a <hi>Divine Mean</hi> for <hi>C. D.</hi> as to <hi>another Action</hi> of a quite differing <hi>Species.</hi> This is now what <hi>Logicians</hi> call <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi.</hi> What he ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 60, and 61. in his 36 <hi>Paragraph,</hi> is much of the ſame ſtrength. The <hi>Author</hi> did ſay, That if <hi>none have an Ability</hi> to <hi>expreſs their own and others Minds fitly to God in Prayer,</hi> then no Man hath <hi>an Ability to make publick Forms;</hi> for in them there muſt be ſuch an <hi>Ability exerciſed.</hi> What doth our Anſwerer conclude from
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105665:51"/> hence? Then, The <hi>Ability to make Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies is the Gift of Prayer, and conſequently muſt be a Divine Mean for the performance of Prayer:</hi> How doth this follow? It will follow indeed, that it is a <hi>Divine Mean,</hi> for the compoſure of a Prayer, but not for the <hi>Action of Prayer;</hi> becauſe it it not the <hi>ability of him that prayeth,</hi> but of other Men, whom God never imployed (ſo far as we yet ſee proved) to find out means for others Actions in his <hi>Worſhip.</hi> But I am not difficult to grant, <hi>That an Ability to make Forms of Prayer is a Divine Mean</hi> for ſome perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as have not attained to an <hi>Ability of themſelves,</hi> fitly to expreſs their mind to God: but will it therefore follow, that it is ſo for them, to whom God hath given another mean, more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and natural?</p>
               <p n="33">33. The Anſwerer <hi>p.</hi> 61. comes to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer my Proofs, which were drawn from thoſe Texts, where Miniſters are from God commanded, not to <hi>neglect their Gifts,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.14. 1 Pet. 4.10, 11. Rom. 12.3, 6. As to the firſt Text, he tells us, 1. That it was a charge not to <hi>neglect his Office.</hi> 2. <hi>That there is not a word ſpoken of Prayer.</hi> To which I reply, 1. That <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in many other places ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a <hi>Gift,</hi> or <hi>Ability</hi> to a Religious Act, in this place ſignifies an <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>not a Gift,</hi> is ſpoken without any proof. 2. That both the words before-going, <hi>Give Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to Reading, to Exhortation, Doctrine,</hi> —
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105665:51"/> and thoſe immediately following: <hi>Meditate on theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to them, — Take heed to thy ſelf and to thy Doctrine,</hi> are vehement Preſumptions to the contrary. 3. I will not deny but it may ſignifie both <hi>Gift,</hi> and <hi>Office,</hi> if that will pleaſe our <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> and that it doth ſignifie both is plain from 20 Texts in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> But it ſeems that it will not, for he goes on and tells us there is not a <hi>Word about Prayer:</hi> Who ſaid there was? I onely urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as a general <hi>Prohibition</hi> of <hi>the neglect of any Miniſterial Gifts,</hi> of which ſurely the <hi>Gift of Prayer</hi> is one. The Argument is, <hi>Miniſters muſt</hi> neglect <hi>no Miniſterial Gift:</hi> Therefore not that of Prayer. But he ſaith, <hi>The Gift of Prayer is not given by the laying on of hands,</hi> nor doth the Text ſay ſo; it ſaith, <hi>By Prophecy with the laying on of hands.</hi> By <hi>Prophecy,</hi> that is, that you might prophecy (ſo <hi>Piſcator, Vatablus,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> render it) or <hi>with Prophecy,</hi> ſo the <hi>Syriack, Arabick and Aethiopick</hi> Verſions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, or by <hi>Prophecy,</hi> ſo the <hi>Vulgar Latine</hi> and our <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> which is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to expound, unleſs (as ſome) we will expound it <hi>per oraculum,</hi> immediately from God. With <hi>Impoſitions of hands,</hi> that is with the Office of the Miniſtry, in which ſenſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> here cannot ſignifie the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but the Gift. But beſides, may not, are not Miniſterial Gifts in a more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meaſure given at the time, vvhen God calls a man out to the Pubiick Miniſtry,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105665:52"/> I am Sure the Scripture tells us, of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirit, given to Perſons at their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out to Places of <hi>Magiſtracy.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſame as to the Miniſtry. But our Anſwerer ſaith it might be meant of <hi>Extraordinary Gifts, which might not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</hi> May then Ordinary Gifts be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected? And is not this an Infallible Anſwer as to any thing we can produce of this Nature? It is but ſaying, <hi>Thoſe Texts refer to the extraordinary Gifts,</hi> tho no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence can be brought of proof for it.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Vindicator</hi> p. 63, ſeems again a little diſpleaſed, <hi>That I ſhould bring a Text to prove an obligation, as to the manner of Performance of Prayer, in which there is no mention of Prayer;</hi> who p. 142. cryed out upon it as <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous</hi> for another to argue from <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.16. Becauſe the Apoſtle praying for <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs,</hi> prayed, That <hi>with one mouth they might Glorifie God,</hi> he might have told the <hi>Reader</hi> alſo, that in that place, I fairly ſtated the Argument which could be drawn from that Text, thus:
<q>
                     <p>Thoſe who are to ſpeak the ſame thing, and are with one mouth to glorifie God; may lawfully, or muſt uſe ſet Forms of Prayer.</p>
                     <p>But Chriſtians are to ſpeak the ſame thing, <hi>1 Cor. 1.10. and</hi> with one mouth to glorifie God — <hi>Ergo — If our</hi> Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator <hi>can make more of it, why doth he not.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I denied the <hi>Major,</hi> and told him, the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105665:52"/> ſame Argument would prove, <hi>Forms of Preaching</hi> neceſſary, and the <hi>ſame Forms</hi> to be uſed in all <hi>Churches, Families</hi> and <hi>Cloſets;</hi> yea and that it was neceſſary for all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to ſpeak the ſame words in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Diſcourſe, <hi>but then I ſhould not have uſed the ſame Logick.</hi> It is true none ought to do that himſelf, which he diſalloweth in another: But have I done it? Let us try. My Argument from that Text, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. lies thus,

                     <p>Thoſe who ought not in their Miniſtry, to neglect their Miniſterial Gift, <hi>ought not</hi> to neglect their Gift of Prayer.</p>

                        <hi>But Miniſters in their</hi> Miniſtry in Prayer, <hi>ought not to</hi> neglect their Miniſterial Gift, <hi>1 Tim. 4.14. — Ergo.</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I think this Arguing is according to an old Rule in Logick, <hi>Quicquid praedicatur de genere praedicatur etiam de ſpecie.</hi> Let but our <hi>Vindicator</hi> prove, That <hi>Miniſters all Praying by one and the ſame Form of Words,</hi> is a <hi>Species</hi> to <hi>Glorifying God with one Mouth,</hi> as I will prove that <hi>Gifts of Prayer</hi> are <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of <hi>Miniſterial Gifts:</hi> and he will ſay ſomething: otherwiſe this is nothing but an ugly <hi>Reflexion,</hi> of which his Book is too full.</p>
               <p>What his quotation from <hi>Grotius</hi> means, I cannot tell: He was no <hi>Father,</hi> no <hi>Divine,</hi> but a <hi>Learned Politician,</hi> very <hi>Erroneous</hi> in his Divinity; of what Authority his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent ſhould be with any ſober Divine, I cannot imagine.</p>

<q>VVhether it be poſſible for any to read any diſcourſe with that degree of Attention of thoughts as he muſt pronounce the ſame with by heart? <hi>It is manifeſt this</hi> Queſtion <hi>was ſtated only with reference to the</hi> Attention <hi>of him that miniſtreth in the duty.</hi>

               <p>Our <hi>Anſwerer</hi> replies, <hi>It is certain this may eaſily be done.</hi> I am clearly of another mind, conſidering, 1. <hi>That there is not a wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thing,</hi> then <hi>Mans imaginative power; nor its wildneſs at any time more ſeen, then in Holy Duties.</hi> Who is able to keep his thoughts fixed upon God, and the matter of his Supplications for one quarter of an hour in Prayer?

                  <note place="margin">Why a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read any thing with like Attention of thoughts, as he may ſpeak it by heart from his own Conceptions.</note> 
                  <hi>my thoughts are more at liberty to wander from what I am about, then while I am ſpeaking, from the Conceptions of my own
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105665:56"/> Heart.</hi> I have an Eye to ſee, and a Tongue to ſpeak, let my thoughts be where they will, as to the main Operations of them, after an habit of Reading once acquired, they have no great buſineſs to do to help me to <hi>read right.</hi> It is no great buſineſs for me to think how to ſound thoſe Letters which my Eyes have before them. But while I ſpeak from my own Conceptions, my thoughts muſt attend my Tongue, or I ſhall ſpeak nothing but <hi>Nonſenſe.</hi> This I did ſay, and do ſay, is to me next to a <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi> onely <hi>I</hi> crave leave to make one term in the <hi>Queſtion</hi> plainer <hi>[by heart.)</hi> I meant, by it from the <hi>Conceptions of his own heart;</hi> and ſo let it ſtand or fall, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcreet Judgment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But ſaith our <hi>Anſwerer, How uſual is it to read the Scriptures and other Books,</hi> with <hi>at great Attention as the ſame things can be ſpoken without Reading? Attention</hi> to what? To the matter he <hi>readeth?</hi> I do doubt that. I am ſure a Mans thoughts in ſuch Services are moſt inclinable to wander, and be imployed about other things, and I am ſure they are more at liberty to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Now conſidering both theſe things, this <hi>poſſibility</hi> is (confidering our imperfect ſtate) very queſtionable; yet will it not follow that then we muſt not read the Scriptures, but always recite them by heart, becauſe God hath made <hi>Reading of them our Duty.</hi> As to this Queſtion let all truly ſpeak as they find, I own the wildneſs of my heart in this thing.</p>

               <q>Whether any thing ean more conduce to fix the thoughts upon the Duty and upon God, then when a man can truſt his Affections, <hi>to</hi> thruſt out words?</q>
               <p>Our Anſwerer ſaith, <hi>That a Devout Senſe of Gods preſence and of his Purity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may,</hi> but he never conſidered that all theſe were pre-neceſſary to <hi>Pious Affections, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe the Affections are not rightly ordered for the duty.</hi> The Queſtion was, Whether the <hi>Affections</hi> being rightly diſpoſed, their thruſting out words did not more conduce, then any Form made by Men could, to fix the thoughts? Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> was of the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it did; <hi>De Caſibus Conſc.</hi> l. 4. 17. cap. qu. 4. the learned Author of <hi>Altare Damaſc.</hi> is of that mind; in ſhort I never met with any that denied it; of neceſſity it muſt be ſo, for there is no <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt ſuch <hi>Affections</hi> and ſuch words to divert or give ſcope of devagation to the thoughts. For our Saviours repeating the ſame words in his Prayers upon his Agony, neither is it ſo in the <hi>Greek,</hi> neither are the words the ſame; but for this I refer the <hi>Reader</hi> to a <hi>Supplement to the Reaſonable Account,</hi> where this ſilly Argument is fully ſpoken to <hi>p.</hi> 99. 100, 101, 102, 103, 104.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The third Queſtion which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded was,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether any ſuch Attention, is to be expected from people to Forms of Prayer, which they often hear, as to a conceived Prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:105665:57"/>
               <p>The <hi>Author</hi> thinks it may be given to the matter of the Prayer: I think ſo too, there is no impoſſibility in the caſe I know of. But the Queſtion was, <hi>Whether it be to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, or hoped for, conſidering the infirmity of all our natures?</hi> This he wiſely leaveth out, and as wiſely replieth nothing to the true Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For what our Author adds in anſwer to an obſervation which I called at leaſt <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious,</hi> tho none of my own; <hi>That God to ſtir up peoples Attentions,</hi> tells his people he will <hi>do a new thing,</hi> he may find it <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 42.9.43.19.<note place="margin">Beſides <hi>Iſ.</hi> 42.9. <hi>new things</hi> are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the <hi>former things.</hi>
                  </note> it is this that the Scripture calls <hi>Admirable things new;</hi> Num. 16.30. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31, 32. But was not their <hi>Newneſs</hi> one thing which made them admirable? I hope both his inſtances were <hi>new things</hi> in the ſtrictneſs of Senſe, for when did the <hi>Earth before open and ſwallow up men alive?</hi> When was any before Chriſt ſo miraculouſly conceived? We do not much uſe to admire things we have ſeen a thouſand times. 2. He asks, <hi>If God never intends to ſtir up mens Affections by his Word, but when he tells them he will do a new thing.</hi> What is that to the purpoſe? Is not therefore <hi>newneſs</hi> of a thing one means to ſtir up Attentions and a great one too, ſo far as it may be uſed without Sin? Then ſurely it may be uſed. He tells us further that <hi>True Religion and Devotion doth always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the ſame things.</hi> Very true, as to the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105665:58"/> 
                  <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> but doth it ſo alſo as to <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Syllables?</hi> Our Anſwerer hath heard of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſpeaking the ſame things in <hi>a new manner;</hi> and certainly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will tell us that the doing this in <hi>Divinity,</hi> as well as in <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> contributes to the generality of Peoples Attention.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He comes <hi>p.</hi> 82. to conſider what I ſaid to prove that <hi>Forms in Prayer</hi> hindred <hi>Fervency.</hi> This I proved, 1. <hi>On the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters part,</hi> from the vaſt difference betwixt <hi>words following the Affections, and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons following of Words,</hi> urged both by Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> and Mr. <hi>Calderwood,</hi> in his <hi>Altare Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcenum.</hi> This our <hi>Anſwerer</hi> grants <hi>as to the firſt uſe of any Form</hi> (but if it cannot be once lawfully uſed how ſhall it be lawfully uſed a ſecond, third, fourth time?) But it is not to be helped after once reading without <hi>Previous Preparation,</hi> as our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer</hi> grants. So as the Queſtion is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can be expected that ordinarily men ſhould uſe ſuch a <hi>Preparation,</hi> as <hi>ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame their Affections to ſuch a degree,</hi> as <hi>the heat ſhould not abate</hi> before they come to their Work. For what he ſaith of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Fervency</hi> as it is not here ſpoken to, (for himſelf quoteth me ſaying no more then— As to him that <hi>miniſtreth, there is a great deal of difference betwixt words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Affections, and Affections following the words</hi>) ſo neither are the People to uſe any words at all, when they joyn with Miniſters in <hi>Conceived Prayer;</hi> therefore

I do believe that no one of the People can be ſo <hi>Fervent</hi> when he joyneth with the Miniſter miniſtring words to him, as when <hi>in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or Cloſet, his Affections thruſt them out of his own heart:</hi> But yet they may be ſo fervent as God requireth of them in ſuch a

This was therefore nothing but another attempt to expoſe me to ſuch as know nothing of a Souls Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God in the Spirit.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105665:59"/> (to return to his 85 <hi>p.</hi>) ſaith, <hi>That this Argument doth not only recoile with equal violence upon my ſelf</hi> (unhappy me to be <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo de ſe</hi> ſo often) <hi>but it is againſt all Vocal Prayer</hi> (I ſhould be ſorry for that, but how doth that appear?) For ſaith he, <hi>The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering Words, Phraſes, Method and Senſe, is a different thing in Conceived Prayer, from the directing the Heart to God, and muſt take up more of his thoughts then the looking upon a Book doth.</hi> But did I ſay then that in Prayer the Soul had nothing more to do, then to direct its Eye to God? I deſire to know where; if I did not, this is nothing to the purpoſe. If he had but conſidered <hi>p.</hi> 30. of the Book, he would have found a great part of an Anſwer to this. The Soul in Prayer is to conſider what it hath to ſay to God; which being conſidered or known, it is to direct it ſelf unto God, with the greateſt <hi>Intention</hi> and leaſt <hi>Diverſion</hi> that it can. Now this I ſay cannot be done ſo well by a Form, as in <hi>Conceived Prayer;</hi> for tho it is true, he who Prayeth <hi>De pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> from the Conceptions of his own Heart, muſt firſt conſider his <hi>Matter</hi> and Words, yet. 1. <hi>This is neceſſary,</hi> ſo are not Forms. 2. <hi>The Soul is all the while imployed upon the work of Prayer, and its Acts are meerly Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and immanent Acts within its ſelf.</hi> But ſo are not its Acts in looking upon, and reading a Form, theſe are plain Diverſions of the Soul to objects without it ſelf, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturally neceſſary, nor from any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105665:60"/> Precept neceſſary to the Action. So that he ſeeth I have not by my Argument deſtroyed all <hi>Vocal Prayer,</hi> but onely <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and eſtabliſhed it.</hi> And for what he faith of the <hi>Peoples hearing and obſerving the words ſpoken by the Miniſter,</hi> it is naturally <hi>neceſſary,</hi> for they cannot elſe ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> It is neceſſary by all thoſe Divine Precepts which have eſtabliſhed <hi>Mental Prayer,</hi> as the Peoples duty, in Communion with him that miniſtreth.</p>
               <p n="10">10. He comes in the next place <hi>p.</hi> 87. to prove, That <hi>Conceived Prayers,</hi> as <hi>the publick</hi> Service of the Church, <hi>may be an Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Devotion.</hi> I have proved that <hi>Forms muſt be</hi> from a <hi>neceſſity of Nature</hi> (as to the Miniſters Devotion at leaſt) He only undertakes to prove, That <hi>Conceived Prayers may be</hi> concerning the <hi>Devotions of the people;</hi> and of this he giveth us a five-fold Account, <q>1. They are not certain that they can joyn in the matter of a new Conceived Prayer, till they have conſidered it. 2. They may be too apt to give their minds too much liberty, to obſerve the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or compoſure; to judge of it or imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it. 3. They hinder Peoples Praying with one Accord. 4. Some want quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Capacity to go along with New Prayers, who can Devoutly and Piouſly joyn with thoſe they have been aequaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. 5. All Impertinencies, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Expreſſions, reſults of Paſſions, Imprudencies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105665:60"/> Prayers; hinder Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, <hi>There is no need of any ſuch thing, that People ſhould afore-hand be certain what Petitions their Miniſters will put up in Prayer, nor doth</hi> God any where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, nor any right reaſon enforce it. How doth it appear that all the <hi>Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Iſrael</hi> were certain before-hand what <hi>Solomon</hi> would, and did pray for, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.22? Or what <hi>Hezekiah</hi> would, and did pray for, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.18. or <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.5. or <hi>Ezra, Ezra</hi> 9.5. It is wonderful theſe great Men could not ſee the neceſſity of this Device, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving Peoples Devotion. Nor doth any <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſhew it. I know nothing any Man or Woman hath to do, who is to joyn with another in Prayer, but keeping his heart in Heaven as much as he can, to attend to the words ſaid, or read by the Miniſter, and making up a judgment on each Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if he or ſhe apprehendeth it to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God, <hi>earneſtly</hi> and <hi>believingly</hi> to deſire it: this they may as we l do upon hearing a Conceived as a Read Prayer.</p>
               <p>For his Second Particular, it is a <hi>May Be,</hi> riſing from Mens Luſts, eaſy to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided without providing Forms, which will as little ſecure the <hi>Devotion</hi> againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Luſts of a far more hainous Nature. 3. The Third is non intelligible, why People may not pray with one <hi>Accord,</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:105665:61"/> whilſt the Miniſter without a Form mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth words to them; eſpecially, if as our Anſwerer told us, in the laſt <hi>Chap. Prayer be not ſo much a Verbal thing.</hi> I am ſure <hi>Prayer</hi> in the Congregation by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is not a <hi>Verbal thing,</hi> but meerly <hi>Mental.</hi> For what he ſaith <hi>Fourthly</hi> it may be true, where People ſtudy <hi>Starcht Prayers,</hi> ſuch as Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> reflects on in his <hi>Ancilla Pietatis,</hi> but in no caſe elſe. 5. For <hi>Impertinencies, Inconvenient Expreſſions,</hi> &amp;c. which we are ſo often told of. I have heard more (ſome within theſe 28 days) from Miniſters falſe reading the <hi>Forms,</hi> then ever I heard from <hi>Conceived Prayers;</hi> both proceed from a non attentive mind, which I am ſure <hi>Forms</hi> will not prevent, but rather give Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to (by allowing the thoughts more liberty to the contrary.)</p>
               <p n="11">11. I have nothing to do with what our Anſwerer ſaith, p. 89, 90, 91, and 92. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not concerned to oppoſe his Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf, from what I never charged him with: But he hath three Obſervations, which begin p. 91. which I muſt concern my ſelf with. The Firſt is:
<q>That Attention, Intention, and Fervency,<note place="margin">P. 91, 92.</note> is not the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs needful to be minded and taken care of in the Publick Service of the Church, but rightly ordered Matter, due Expreſſions, and Behaviour; and here Forms have the advantage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, not at all. As to <hi>Behaviour,</hi> a law
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105665:61"/> may help that, but ſure a Form of Prayer cannot. For the other Two things, they are no more neceſſary to be taken care for, as to <hi>Prayer,</hi> then as to <hi>Preaching.</hi> Then it ſeems all Miniſters muſt Preach by <hi>Forms</hi> too, or elſe the Church ought to take care, that Miniſters for Matter and Phraſe ſpeak fitly in the Peoples name to God; but need take no care that Miniſters ſpeak fitly in Gods Name to the People. 3. The care the Church ought to take, ſhould be, That none be admitted as Miniſters in it, who are not able to do both; and when all is done, ſome Errors will be. Another thing he ſaith that muſt be cared for, is, <hi>That Mens Devotion may be ſo, as not to croſs other Duties.</hi> It is impoſſible it ſhould, for it would no longer be <hi>Devotion.</hi> But what other duty will be hindred by <hi>Conceived Prayer?</hi> That which he inſtanceth in is <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Obedience to Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</hi> But are theſe <hi>Duties,</hi> when the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs contended for, is that this thing (ſo far as the Perſons concerned can judge, and as they are ready to argue) is not lawful? And when they oppoſe the firſt and great Commandment. To which the Second (tho like to it, I and to which both theſe relate) is and ought to be ſubordinate.</p>
               <p n="12">12. His Second Obſervation is, <hi>That there may be a want of due Devotion, Attention,</hi> and <hi>Fervency, in thoſe that uſe Forms, and yet this not proceed from the Form.</hi> This is doubtleſs true, <hi>if he meaneth ſolely, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105665:62"/> chiefly;</hi> but what is this to the purpoſe, when the buſineſs of the Argument is, to prove that in him that <hi>miniſtreth,</hi> a Form muſt neceſſarily hinder degrees of <hi>Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Fervency?</hi> This obſervation is true, or falſe, as his anſwer to the Argument is good or bad; which I leave to the <hi>Reader</hi> to judge from my reply to it.</p>
               <p n="13">13 His Third obſervation. <hi>p.</hi> 95. is:
<q>That Publick Service ought to be ſo ordered, as may fit the General Temper of the true Chriſtian Spirit, but muſt not be cenſured if it fit not with the Inclinations of all particular Perſons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Agreed, therefore ſaid the Author, let it be ſo ordered, that thoſe who deſire it, may have a Miniſter to pray with and for them, by a Form, and others may have one that may pray <hi>with</hi> and <hi>for them, from the Conceptions of his own Heart.</hi> It is very like the <hi>True Chriſtian Spirit</hi> may be found in the latter, as much as in the former, if that Spirit be a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and of the <hi>Fear of the Lord,</hi> of <hi>Love to God,</hi> and <hi>Communion with God,</hi> as I think it is, and believe moſt Chriſtians are of my mind.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. THe Anſwerer begins his Second Section, p. 98. with telling us, That he propoſed it as uſeful, to try the Iſſue of the thing in queſtion, <hi>viz. Whether Forms of Prayer were any prejudice to Piety or Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To conſult the judgment of them who are leaſt partial, and yet able to make a true eſtimate, and eſpecially to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Evidences of Reaſon, which may be produced.</q> He ſaith, I agreed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105665:63"/> it. But how? take my words, <hi>p.</hi> 44.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Indeed it is very reaſonable in this caſe, That if the Propoſition be not of that Nature, with reference to ſeveral Perſons, that the experience of Chriſtians be variable in the caſe, it is reaſonable that the Major part of pious and able ſhould be taken into Judgment, or rather Counſel. — But I further told him, That we believe the Experience of Chriſtians may be really different in this caſe: ſome may find the uſe of their own Gifts more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous, others may poſſibly find Forms more advantageous; it depends much on the degree of the Gift each one hath received. But every one, is bound to uſe that lawful means which he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r an obligation a divine obligation not to uſe Forms, another for the preſent to uſe them. So as I did not think this matter of a Superiours command,</hi> becauſe an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal command</hi> here, muſt neceſſarily treſpaſs (as to ſome) upon a Divine Obligation, which hath pre-obliged them to the contrary; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Attention and Fervency in Prayer; which they muſt not violate, in obedience to any man, as all Divines agree.

               <p>Now <hi>good Reader</hi> obſerve what our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer</hi> (who hath ſo often told the World, there is no weight no ſtrength, no truth in what I ſay) replyeth to this.</p>

                  </note> They plainly ſay they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with them both. Let us ſee that. The words of the <hi>Leyden</hi> Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in the place cited, are theſe:</p>

                  <q>There is a Queſtion uſually made <hi>(ſo it is no novel Queſtion)</hi> whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to uſe Forms of Prayer, publickly or privately? We ſay, If they be <hi>pronounced with due attention of Mind</hi> [mark pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced] and with due attention, they are not only lawful, but very profitable. 1. Becauſe every Chriſtian hath not an Ability, and the attention of the People in great Meetings is not a little helped by uſual Forms. Upon which account God himſelf directed the Prieſts a Form of Bleſſing under the Old Teſtament, <hi>Num.</hi> 6.24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Chriſt upon the Croſs is obſerved to uſe that Form of Depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which <hi>David.</hi> (who was a type of him) uſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46. and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2. asked Chriſt to teach them to Pray, as <hi>John</hi> taught his Diſciples. To whom Chriſt anſwered, When you Pray, ſay <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. from which Circumſtances of the Words, it is manifeſt, that this Prayer of Chriſt was not only a Rule to Pray by, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a <hi>Form of Prayer,</hi> as all the

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. This is all which thoſe learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors ſay. Now I muſt profeſs I ſee no reaſon for what our <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſaith, That the <hi>Walachrians</hi> could not agree with Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> and the <hi>Leyden Profeſſors</hi> too; one thing is, Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> is put firſt: Whether they alſo agreed with the <hi>Leyden Profeſſors,</hi> is not much material, let thoſe word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> be blotted out. I have enough to make me underſtand their Senſe upon the Queſtion, in their telling me, They readily agree with Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> in this <hi>Controverſie.</hi> If it be not poſſible they ſhould agree with the <hi>Leyden Profeſſors</hi> too, then their Teſtimony againſt us ſignifies nothing, for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted themſelves, and Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> did not agree with thoſe of <hi>Leyden;</hi> but I do not think ſo.

                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:105665:67"/>8. Nothing can be certainly concluded in the cauſe, but I think I ſhall offer what any unbiaſt Reader ſhall judge very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in the Cauſe. All Divines that will ſpeak clearly and diſtinctly in this Cauſe, muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>ſuch as are more imperfect and low in Knowledge and Gifts,</hi> and <hi>ſuch as are more grown and perfect.</hi> So that Acute Caſuiſt Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> diſtinguiſheth; and certainly ſo do the <hi>Leyden Profeſſors,</hi> and it is apparent from their <hi>words:</hi> 2. They (like Divines) accordingly deliver their minds in two <hi>Theſes.</hi> The one (which is the 33) relating only to <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, in a more <hi>Imperfect State,</hi> while they have not the <hi>Gift of Prayer:</hi> As to theſe, they determine <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> both <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary,</hi> eſpecially where ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in a <hi>low ſtate of the Church,</hi> have <hi>great Congregations,</hi> for there their hearers are more advantaged doubtleſs by a Form, then they would be by the uſe of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons own Abilities (for they are not two Sentences, but one; <hi>becauſe every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that is to Miniſter, hath not an Ability, and [in ſuch caſes] the hearers are more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged by Forms,</hi> and the Perſon mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring doth well, for tho he offereth a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, he hath no Male in his flock; for of all the inſtances they give, there is not one other. Such was the ſtate of all the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Jews,</hi> of all the Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> his own Diſciples, before the days of <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> prophecyed of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105665:68"/> under the Old Teſtament, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Joel, when God would pour out his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit on all Fleſh,</hi> Acts 2.17. Joel 2.28. that is, imperfect comparatively, with what it was after the Effuſion of the Spirit. Upon this Account Chriſt ſaith, Tho to that day there had not appeared <hi>Born of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, one greater then</hi> John <hi>Baptiſt, yet the leaſt in the Kingdom of God, ſhould be greater then he;</hi> greater as to <hi>Spiritual Gifts, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tterance,</hi> able to ſpeak greater things then he could. And the Promiſes are to Chriſts Diſciples for <hi>doing greater things</hi> (not then Chriſt could do, but) then <hi>he did do,</hi> becauſe he was aſcending to <hi>his Father, John</hi> 14.18. with many others of like import, proveth this. And it is certain that till that time, the Apoſtles had very imperfect <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the great <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt and his Father, John</hi> 14.8, 9. The <hi>Sitting at Chriſts right hand in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> &amp;c. And in this ſtate, and during this ſtate, it is not unreaſonable to think <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould give his Diſciples a <hi>Form of Prayer</hi> at their requeſt, yea of <hi>words</hi> to be uſed in Prayer.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In the 34 <hi>Theſis</hi> theſe Learned Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors determine in the caſe, <hi>as to ſuch as</hi> are <hi>Provectiores,</hi> better grown, for theſe they judiciouſly determine (and eſpecially for thoſe amongſt them, that are Paſtors of Churches) <hi>that it was advantageous, yea up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point neceſſary</hi> for them, <hi>To ſtir up

               <p n="10">10. So that I ſee no difference betwixt the judgments of Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Leyden</hi> in the caſe.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105665:69"/> the Miniſtry, and have any abilities for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every where very ſmall. Our <hi>Vindicator</hi> laying no great ſtreſs upon this Teſtimony (as he tells, p. 111.) we ſee no great reaſon to contend for the Senſe, it being but the Senſe of a <hi>particular Claſis,</hi> and we being fully of the mind of thoſe great perſons with whom they profeſs to agree, it is no great matter whether we agree with them or no, becauſe they cannot agree with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as our Anſwerer noteth.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Our <hi>Vindicator</hi> goeth on and telleth us, he had in his <hi>Libertas Eccleſiaſtica</hi> brought three <hi>Arguments,</hi> to prove, <hi>That forms of Prayer</hi> were of no diſadvantage <hi>to Piety.</hi> The firſt was <hi>From Gods preſcribing a conſtant form of Prayer for the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and for the</hi> Prieſts <hi>bleſſing, our Saviours directing the Lords Prayer, but the Holy God, our Bleſſed Saviour, would not impoſe what is of its own nature an hindrance to Godlineſs, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and Religion.</hi> My Anſwer was to this Senſe. That it was wild (in a matter of Worſhip eſpecially) to conclude, mans pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from Gods fact. That becauſe God might preſcribe, therefore man might preſcribe. Our <hi>Vindicator</hi> here now tells us, <hi>He is not ſo void of all Reverence to God, as ſo much as to think ſo.</hi> I truely hope ſo, much leſs ſo void of all ſenſe and Reaſon, but what then is that which our Anſwerer would conclude from thence? <hi>That theſe things cannot prejudice Religion,</hi> he ſaith.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If we could once agree upon <hi>terms,</hi> I would hope all ſober and good men would
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105665:69"/> agree. That which makes us differ, is we uſe General terms of <hi>Religion, Piety,</hi> The <hi>Church, Schiſme, Seperation,</hi> &amp;c. and will never let one another underſtand what we mean by them. <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> here are theſe aequivocal Terms that deceive one party. We are here arguing about <hi>Prayer,</hi> as it is a part of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Worſhip of God,</hi> and in no other ſenſe. <hi>Inſtituted Worſhip,</hi> is not what is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> but by the <hi>Will of God revealed in his Word.</hi> We ſay that it is thus commanded by God, not onely that we ſhould pray, but that we ſhould pray with the utmoſt <hi>Attention of our thoughts, to our work, and with the utmoſt intention of our mind, and pious fervour.</hi> This (ſay we) we profeſs we cannot do by forms. Yes (ſaith our <hi>Vindicator</hi> you may, or elſe <hi>God would never have preſcribed forms of Prayer</hi> and <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to the <hi>Jewiſh Prieſts,</hi> nor <hi>Chriſt to his Diſciples.</hi> How doth this follow? Is God then obliged, in a piece of Service, (which is no ſervice to him, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſo <hi>willed it</hi>) to <hi>will it to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> and <hi>at all times, under the ſame Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances?</hi> Who will deny a <hi>Prince</hi> the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to direct one <hi>Subject</hi> to perform his Homage to him one way, and another to pay it another way; yea though the Act of <hi>Homage</hi> be ſpecifically the ſame? And ſhall we deny God that liberty, who is the moſt free of all Agents, and the King of Kings?</p>
               <p n="14">14. So that the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> either very
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105665:70"/> 
                  <hi>weakly,</hi> or very invidiouſly ſaith, That the ſenſe of my Anſwer is, <q>That the God of infinite Goodneſs, and Purity, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, and enjoyn, and conſequently may be pleaſed with ſuch things as in their own Nature are hurtful to Piety, and oppoſe Piety and Goodneſs in the World:</q> when as the ſenſe of my Anſwer (as is obvious to every underſtanding Reader) is no more then this, That the God of infinite liberty to direct his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in what manner he pleaſeth, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſeveral perſons in ſeveral ages, and under ſeveral diſpenſations, yea, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons in the ſame age, to Worſhip him in the ſame <hi>ſpecifical Acts of Worſhip,</hi> ſeveral ways as he pleaſeth, and each of them becauſe he ſo appoints them, ſhall be <hi>Pious, Religious, Good,</hi> and <hi>Pure,</hi> and that as to thoſe Perſons whom he ſo commands, moſt Good, Pious and Religious.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And upon this foundation it was, That it was Pious to the Jews to Worſhip God by the <hi>Levitical Offerings,</hi> &amp;c. which to us would be impious, not only becauſe he hath expreſly forbidden them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not commanded us any ſuch thing: And if <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> did preſcribe <hi>Forms of Prayer or Praiſe</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> or to ſome particular <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> under ſome particular <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> the uſe of them as to them, or any under the ſame Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, may be <hi>Pious,</hi> and <hi>Religious,</hi> and doubtleſs is ſo, and yet not ſo to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105665:70"/> who are or may be under other <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> and other <hi>Precepts,</hi> relating to them as under ſuch Circumſtances; and this is our very Caſe. <hi>Perſons that have not Abilities fitly to expreſs their Minds to God in Prayer,</hi> are under <hi>different Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> from <hi>thoſe who have ſuch Abilities,</hi> and ſo may be under <hi>different Obligations</hi> of <hi>Divine Precepts</hi> in the caſe.

But in the mean time, theſe precepts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige all to their utmoſt Ability to do it. And this is a full, or at leaſt a ſufficient Anſwer to what our <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſaith in his long <hi>Vindication</hi> of his Argument from his 113 to his 129 page. For, not to multiply words to no purpoſe, let men believe what they will, whether the <hi>Form of Bleſſing</hi> was to be uſed as a <hi>Form,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> to <hi>be uſed as a Form,</hi> yea or no. (Great Authors are in both ſides in the caſe) It proveth no more, then that <hi>Forms of Prayer are not in themſelves ſo evil, that God himſelf cannot preſcribe and legitimate them;</hi> which none but mad men will ſay they are, or (as this Author phraſeth it) that they are not <hi>in their own Nature hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and ſo hurtful, as <hi>God cannot</hi> command the uſe of them, which is a degree of badneſs, which very few things have. In
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105665:71"/> the mean time they may be <hi>ſinful enough,</hi> as contrary to the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> and that tho not to all Perſons, yet to ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; which is all I contend for.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And here I muſt crave pardon of my <hi>Reader</hi> for giving ſome inſtances of things which God by his command could not legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, as to thoſe perſons to whom he gave the command. <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Inceſt,</hi> I admire how they ſlipt my pen (tho our Vindicator who laſheth me ſufficiently for much leſſer Errors then this, taketh no notice of it) for tho it be true, God cannot make <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Inceſt</hi> lawful, yet that is but trifling, becauſe they will not be <hi>Murther</hi> or <hi>Inceſt</hi> when he hath commanded them. But God by a <hi>Special command</hi> to particular perſons, may make thoſe actions lawful, which if any others did without ſuch a <hi>ſpecial command,</hi> they would be <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Inceſt,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: So it was lawful by vertue of Gods command to <hi>Abraham</hi> for him to <hi>think upon,</hi> and <hi>deſign the killing of his Son,</hi> to <hi>prepare means for it</hi> and <hi>go about it,</hi> and alſo to have done it. But I hope our <hi>Vindicator</hi> doth not think this would have been, or is lawful for any other perſons, under the circumſtance of <hi>no ſuch ſpecial command;</hi> and this will let the <hi>Reader</hi> ſee how little to the purpoſe the <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſpeaks of this <hi>p.</hi> 116. I appeal to every man of Senſe, whether that inſtance was not good enough to prove, That God by his command may make ſome things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which without ſuch command to thoſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105665:71"/> particular perſons, had been unlawful, and are unlawful, as contrary to his Revealed Will, as to any others who have no <hi>ſuch command,</hi> but his <hi>General Rule</hi> to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. What but the ſpecial Command of God to Magiſtrates, makes it lawful for them to execute malefactors, or by their Souldiers to kill men in juſt wars? What but the <hi>ſpecial permiſſion</hi> or <hi>licenſe of God,</hi> makes it lawful to <hi>kill men</hi> breaking open their houſes, or in their <hi>own defence.</hi> The General Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> But this is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly enough to ſhew his poor <hi>Vindication</hi> of his firſt Argument founded on this <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,</hi> That we ſay, <hi>Forms of Prayer do in their own Nature hinder Piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. The truth is, there are ſome things ſo intrinſically evil that <hi>God cannot make them lawful;</hi> but theſe are very few (nor are all men agreed in this) for my own part I do agree with thoſe who think, there are <hi>Eternal I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea's</hi> both <hi>of Good and Evil</hi> (I know it is a Subtil Queſtion) but I cannot think that God can authorize a perſon, to <hi>deny his Being,</hi> or to <hi>Blaſpheme himſelf:</hi> God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny himſelf, nor expoſe his own <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Glory.</hi> But that God cannot make the ſame thing both <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>unlawful,</hi> the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which at all, or in ſuch or ſuch a manner, does meerly <hi>depend upon his Will,</hi> is to me little better then <hi>Nonſenſe.</hi> Now whether God would be worſhipped, or ſhould be worſhipped by <hi>Vocal Prayer or no?</hi> certainly depends upon his <hi>Will,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105665:72"/> but his Will; and if it be his will that all Perſons ſhould do it with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt attention of thoughts, and intention of mind, and fervor of ſpirit, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And if one perſon be not able to do it, by forms preſcribed by other men, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother be beſt able to do it ſo, it is plain that the Will of God in the caſe is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as to theſe two perſons: and to tell us, that the firſt perſon may do it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to his piety in the action, when all the piety of the action lyeth in <hi>Obedience to the Will of God,</hi> ſounds in my Ears, very Atheologically, and awkly, to ſay no worſe concerning it.</p>
               <p n="17">17. This miſerable arguing makes me quite weary of replying (my hand is in, and I ſhall go through, but I think never to take up a pen again in this Caſe) p. 129. the <hi>Vindicator</hi> comes to Vindicate his Second Argument, which was from the lawfulneſs of <hi>Singing Pſalms in Meeter,</hi> and <hi>Reading the Scriptures:</hi> We muſt put it into Form, or the Reader will never ſee the force or weakneſs of it. His Argument could be but this,
<q>If the Scriptures may be read with ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt attention of thoughts, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of Spirit, and Pſalms may be ſung (and that in Meeter) with the utmoſt intention of Spirit, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Thoughts, and they yet be Forms, and not the the dictates of our Hearts to our Lipps; Then
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105665:72"/> 
                     <hi>Prayers</hi> may be put up to God by Forms compoſed by other Men, not divinely inſpired, with the utmoſt attention of our thoughts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and fervor of our ſpirits. — But. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſumm of my Anſwer was a denial of the conſequence. My reaſons were, and are: <hi>Becauſe theſe were Duties of different ſpecies,</hi> and the <hi>ſame Motions, Affections, and Degrees of Affection, are not by God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us in all Duties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is no Rule of <hi>Logick,</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that <hi>whatſoever may be affirmed or denied of</hi> one <hi>Species,</hi> may be <hi>affirmed of another;</hi> for then we might conclude in <hi>Animals,</hi> that an Horſe can diſcourſe, becauſe Man can. It is as true in <hi>Actions,</hi> in Religious Actions. <hi>Worſhip</hi> here is the. <hi>Genus, Reading the Scriptures, Singing Pſalms, Praying, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>Species</hi> contained under <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> as the <hi>Genus:</hi> We can neither affirm nor deny, all things concerning one of theſe <hi>Species,</hi> that we may affirm or deny of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. This is evident now to all, and might be juſtified in forty inſtances. The Queſtion therefore is, <hi>Whether God requireth the ſame affections, and the ſame degree</hi> of <hi>fervor of Spirit,</hi> in <hi>Reading the Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>Sing ng of Pſalms,</hi> that he doth <hi>require of us in Prayer?</hi> If he doth not, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is <hi>fallacious,</hi> becauſe of the manifeſt Tranſition <hi>De Genere ad Genus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. It is plain he doth not. Prayer (as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105665:73"/> I told him, p. 61.) is in Scripture called, a <hi>crying to God,</hi> a <hi>wreſtling with him, a powring out of our Souls,</hi> it muſt be with <hi>ſtrong cries and groans.</hi> Is there any ſuch thing ſaid of <hi>Reading the Scriptures?</hi> Or of <hi>Singing Pſalms?</hi> Attention of our thoughts indeed is required in all, ſo are ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Fervor as are proper to thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but what if God will require ſome degrees of Homage to be performed to him one way, ſome another, ſome in a way not capable of the like degrees of <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> and <hi>Fervour,</hi> as others are (ſuch I take reading the Scriptures to be) is it not enough for us to do that duty, with ſuch degrees of Attention and Fervour, as he requires in that duty, tho we do not do it with ſuch degrees of Attention and Fervour, as in that duty he hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired? Or ſhall it be concluded by any man of reaſon, that the mean which God hath appointed by which we may ſerve him in one duty (as in <hi>Reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> it is nothing but the uſe of our ability to read) which is not by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of our nature capable of ſuch an attention of our thoughts (which will wander if they have the leaſt liberty) may be uſed in another duty of another <hi>Species,</hi> where God requires other <hi>degrees of Attention and Fervour:</hi> or that the mean which he hath given us for that duty is not neceſſary, but that duty alſo may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be performed in the uſe of a mean,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105665:73"/> which doth hinder ſuch degrees of Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Fervour?</p>
               <p n="19">19. This was the ſubſtance of one of my Anſwers (tho a little further opened.) now what ſaith our Vindicator to this? Truly little, what he ſaith is p. 135. in theſe words and no more. <q>But what he ſaith That there are different workings of the Soul towards God in Singing, and in Prayer, I ſuppoſe he will upon further conſideration diſcern to be an overſight, ſince the Application to God for the ſame things, require the ſame Pious Exerciſes of Mind, whether it be in Proſe, or Meeter; and it was another overſight, that he declares me to know and confeſs what he thus aſſerts, when I never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared any ſuch thing, but know the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</q> — As to the laſt Clauſe Reader judge, ſee <hi>Libertas Eccleſ.</hi> p. 123. — <q>Both in reading the Scriptures, and in Prayer, our hearts ought to be religiouſly moved towards God, tho in ſomwhat a different manner.</q> Wherein have I wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him here? Neither ſee I reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the overſight: let him prove if he can, that we are obliged to <hi>Sing Pſalms</hi> with an equal degree of <hi>Fervor of Spirit</hi> at all times, as we are to <hi>Pray.</hi> Though we may ſing the <hi>Words</hi> of a <hi>Prayer,</hi> yet it is more then I know, that we are to make thoſe words our <hi>Petitions,</hi> or to addreſs our Souls unto God for the ſame things which are the matter of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> we Sing. If I
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105665:74"/> thought ſo, I ſhould hardly ſing many of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, having no occaſion for the things he asked of God. Nor do I think Singing is <hi>the Application of our Souls to God for obtaining Mercies,</hi> but the Praedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Holy Name and Will of God,</hi> and only to differ from <hi>Reading the Scripture,</hi> as the firſt is done with the <hi>Modulation of the Voice,</hi> the other not ſo; which <hi>Modu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> is required, as having ſome force in it to excite ſeveral <hi>Affections,</hi> either of <hi>Joy</hi> or <hi>Grief,</hi> according to the matter ſung. Further in the ſame page he ſaith:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Tho there be different Acts of the Mind exerciſed in theſe duties, yet that Conſideration, Reverence, Faith, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and other Gracious Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſuit the ſpecial parts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth; doth require as much ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, diligence and care in reading the holy Scriptures.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But doth it require as much <hi>Fervour of Spirit and Affections?</hi> That is the Queſtion; and the contrary was ſhewed by the Phraſes wherein <hi>Prayer</hi> is in Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: but as to this not a word, onely <hi>he had ſhewed before, that a Form of Words in Prayer doth not hinder any Exerciſes of Piety therein.</hi> What he hath formerly ſaid, I have formerly anſwered.

               <p n="20">20. I had further told him, That the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are <hi>Divine Forms,</hi> and <hi>reading

               <p n="1">1. OUR <hi>Vindicator</hi> in his 4 Chap. which beginneth in his 177 p. pretendeth to Anſwer the <hi>Authors</hi> third <hi>Argument,</hi> which he had thus laid:
<q>
                     <p>To uſe a Mean in an Act of Worſhip, which God hath neither directed by the light of Nature, nor by his Word pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; no natural neceſſity compelling us ſo to do, is ſinful.</p>
                     <p>But for us or any of us, to whom God hath given the Gift of Prayer, ordinarily to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105665:79"/> perform our Miniſterial Acts in Prayer,<note place="margin">Reaſonable Account, p. 71.</note> by the preſcribed Forms of other Men, read, or ricited, were for us (no natural neceſſity compelling us ſo to do) in Acts of Worſhip to uſe means, neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected of God by the light of Nature, nor yet by him in his Word preſcribed. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In proof of the <hi>Major</hi> I ſaid, 1. That <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip,</hi> is nothing elſe but an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage performed to God upon account of his Excellency.</hi> 2. That it belongs to God to appoint thoſe <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> by whom this <hi>Homage</hi> ſhould be paid. 3. That God hath determined (by the light of Nature, and his Word given us) ſufficiently both as to <hi>Acts</hi> and Means, of this <hi>Homage.</hi> 4. That he hath forbidden any other <hi>Means</hi> in the Second Commandment, where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of <hi>Graven Images,</hi> he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids all <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> which himſelf hath not appointed; and if this were not the ſenſe of it, it were impoſſible to reduce to that Commandment, all the Precepts in Scripture as to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Adoration.</hi> I alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther referred to what Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> hath ſaid in this Caſe, in his <hi>Advertiſements</hi> upon a <hi>Diſcourſe of Set Forms of Prayer</hi> p. 17. 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In my further Diſcourſe upon this <hi>Argument,</hi> I was led (in Anſwer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother) into a diſcourſe about <hi>The power
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105665:79"/> of Superiors, in Gods Worſhip, to command, what they judged indifferent;</hi> but their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors</hi> or <hi>Parties commanded judged ſinful, and unlawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Poſſibly that diſcourſe, contained two <hi>Queſtions</hi> in <hi>Divinity,</hi> upon which the main hinge of this Controverſie lay; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Whether man can lawfully inſtitute at his pleaſure Parts or Means of Divine Worſhip?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Whether Superiors can command Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, in Divine VVorſhip, to do any thing, which they the Superiors judge indifferent,</hi> (that is neither commanded, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God) <hi>but the Inferiours judge ſinful, upon Arguments which to them appear highly probable.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Let us but be agreed in theſe two things, and we ſhall in this <hi>Controverſie</hi> have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to contend about. Our <hi>Vindicator,</hi> who (in the <hi>Section</hi> immediately preceding, had ſpent 6 leaves in nothing but <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſpends but 8 leaves about this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which I doubt not but to ſhew him (except he had ſpoken cloſer to the thing in queſtion) was much too little. But what doth he ſay?</p>
               <p n="3">3. He granteth p. 177. <hi>That all the parts of Divine VVorſhip muſt be ſuch as the light of Nature, or the Revealed VVill of God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth.</hi> Tho this be very true, yet what is it to the purpoſe? The Argument ſpake not of <hi>Parts,</hi> but of <hi>Means</hi> of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, nor doth the ſecond <hi>Commandment,</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:105665:80"/> ſpeak only of <hi>Parts</hi> but of <hi>Means.</hi> Why doth he not either <hi>affirm</hi> or <hi>deny, that the Means of External VVorſhip, muſt be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from God, either by the light of Nature or Scripture?</hi> But inſtead of this he runs to his uſual way of <hi>Obſervations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. He firſt obſerveth, That this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth what I had before ſaid, <hi>That Forms of Prayer may be lawfully uſed</hi> [by ſome men, and at ſometimes] what if it did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict what I ſaid before? The Argument may be good enough, notwithſtanding <hi>Nemo omnibus horis ſapit.</hi> 2. But this is <hi>not ſo,</hi> for we are diſcourſing of what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or unlawful, not as to what is meerly <hi>Mental Prayer,</hi> but as to <hi>Miniſterial Vocal Prayer,</hi> which is the moſt perfect kind of Prayer: I have told him, that I believed, that he who prayed by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Forms,</hi> only prayeth in <hi>his Heart.</hi> Now as to that <hi>Act, Forms</hi> may be <hi>helps,</hi> and ſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be uſed by thoſe to whom God hath not given <hi>due means</hi> for <hi>Miniſterial</hi> Prayer, which muſt be <hi>Vocal,</hi> where the heart <hi>inditeth a good Matter,</hi> and the tongue (the proper Secretary to the heart) <hi>is as the Pen of a ready Writer.</hi> Now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing (what our Anſwerer ſo zealouſly contends for) that God preſcribed Forms to the <hi>Jewiſh Miniſters,</hi> and that Chriſt <hi>Preſcribed his Diſciples Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> to be ordinarily uſed. <hi>Means</hi> as to <hi>Heart-Prayer,</hi> are preſcribed by God in his Word, as to which kind of Prayer, words are
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105665:80"/> not neceſſary, for it may be performed without words, ſo as words are no <hi>parts of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Forms</hi> not <hi>directed by God or Chriſt, or any where in Holy Writ,</hi> cannot be an <hi>External Homage to God, or part of Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Worſhip;</hi> for our Author grants, that <hi>Parts of Worſhip</hi> muſt be directed by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> or <hi>Scripture;</hi> now ſuch Forms are not directed by <hi>Scripture;</hi> I am ſure they are not directed by <hi>Nature.</hi> Beſides, if they were an <hi>External Worſhip, or part of it,</hi> they muſt be never omitted. Now that <hi>Vocal Prayer</hi> is a part of <hi>External Worſhip,</hi> diſtinct from what is meerly <hi>Mental,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied; for that Prayer which is meerly in the heart, I am ſure is not the <hi>Publik Worſhip</hi> of a <hi>Miniſter in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence it followeth, That he who prayeth by Forms only, prayeth <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,</hi> as all the People do, who joyneth with him who Miniſtreth in Prayer: For the Miniſters <hi>reading</hi> a <hi>Form, can be no part of External Worſhip,</hi> becauſe in it, he is neither directed by the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> nor <hi>by the Will of God in Scripture.</hi> It is only an <hi>help</hi> to himſelf or others, or both, to order himſelf, and people by, in their <hi>Mentall Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Neither can I ſee how it can properly be called a <hi>Mean</hi> (unleſs the <hi>Form</hi> be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by God directed) of <hi>Mental Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> For in reaſon, the mean of <hi>meer inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105665:81"/> adorotion</hi> muſt be, <hi>an Ability</hi> ſo to <hi>adore</hi> which a man hath partly from <hi>Nature;</hi> (whence is his Ability to think and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) partly from the influence of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Spirit of Prayer and Supplication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. His next <hi>Obſervation</hi> is as idle, as his <hi>Reflection</hi> in that Paragraph founded upon it is <hi>impertinent:</hi> it is this p. 179. <q>That according to this Argument, the conceptions and expreſſions of him who Prayeth without a Form, are as much forbidden as the uſe of Forms is pretended to be, becauſe God hath not preſcribed theſe Expreſſions.</q> I had told him, that both the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> and the Will of God declared in his Word, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. have ſhewed us, <hi>That an ability fitly to expreſs our minds</hi> that is our wants and deſires] <hi>to God in Prayer, is the means which God hath preſcribed for Vocal Prayer;</hi> how well he hath diſproved what I ſaid, let the Reader judge from my reply; ſo that in further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this his <hi>Obſervation,</hi> I ſhall but oppoſe another obſervation, and commend it to my Reader; <hi>viz. That he hath anſwered my Argument learnedly, by begging the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</hi> for this was the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="9">9. But yet becauſe our Author hath no mind to treat of <hi>Means,</hi> and to grant us that <hi>Means</hi> as well as <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Divine Worſhip,</hi> muſt have a <hi>Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> Let us take him at his own conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>That parts of Worſhip</hi> muſt have ſuch
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105665:81"/> an Inſtitution; this he yieldeth <hi>in terminis,</hi> p. 177. I ſay that words in <hi>Vocal Prayer,</hi> are <hi>parts of Worſhip;</hi> his friend <hi>Capellus</hi> he owns hath affirmed it, <hi>That by keeping to the conſtant uſe of a Form, men make it a proper part of Worſhip.</hi> This he doth not like. But why then in the very ſame caſe about <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> doth he choke us with what <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellus</hi> hath ſaid.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vindicat.</hi> p. 167, 173, 201.</note> It is a juſt Rule in Law, <hi>That he who hath produced a Witneſs in</hi> the <hi>ſame cauſe for himſelf, hath granted him a ſufficient Witneſs, and ſhall never be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to except againſt him as not ſuch.</hi> I hope if <hi>Capellus</hi> his Authority be valuable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, it is ſo for us.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But I have another Argument to prove, that <hi>Forms of Prayer <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,</hi> are <hi>parts of Prayer,</hi> proper <hi>parts of Prayer,</hi> that is <hi>Vocal Prayer,</hi> which alone is <hi>Miniſterial Prayer:</hi> For the parts of that religious Action are <hi>Two;</hi> The one is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi> which lyeth in the Motions of the Heart and Affections: The other is <hi>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> which are <hi>Our words.</hi> And theſe are the two <hi>Eſſential parts</hi> of <hi>Worſhip</hi> in that <hi>Prayer;</hi> take away either of them, and it is <hi>no Prayer,</hi> that is <hi>no Miniſterial Vocal Prayer:</hi> And theſe or thoſe words are eſſential parts of this or that Miniſterial Vocal Prayer. Now if Men without expreſs direction from God, may preſcribe us <hi>words,</hi> they may preſcribe an <hi>Eſſential part of VVorſhip;</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:105665:82"/> which our <hi>Vindicator</hi> juſtly denieth they may.</p>
               <p n="11">11. His third Obſervation, p. 182. is, That in his <hi>Libertas Eccleſiaſtica.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect. Chap.</hi> 1. He hath largely proved, <q>
                     <hi>That it is a falſe and dangerous Poſition to ſay that</hi> nothing may be uſed, or appointed in Gods Worſhip (beſides neceſſary Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of humane Actions) but what is appointed by God himſelf. — He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth here, That it is deſtructive to <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick VVorship and Religion.</hi> For ſince God hath commanded us to pray, but hath not in all Acts of Worſhip enjoyned our words, or the performance of this duty with or without a Form, it muſt needs according to this Poſition, be done neither by a Form nor without, becauſe both by conſequence are forbidden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not preſcribed. Then he telleth us, That God hath not preſcribed what ſort of bread, or wine, ſhould be uſed in the Supper of the Lord, nor what Pſalms ſhould be ſang.</q> To which I reply,</p>
               <p n="12">12. I am not at leiſure to reply to all he hath ſaid in 72 pages of his <hi>Libertas Eccleſiaſt.</hi> but I do not remember that he hath there ſaid, That Men may appoint <hi>Eſſential,</hi> or integral <hi>parts of VVorſhip;</hi> if he hath, I am ſure he hath denyed it here, p. 177. Now I have both ſaid, and <hi>proved,</hi> that <hi>words</hi> are an <hi>Eſſential part of Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, Vocal Prayer.</hi> If there be no words uſed, there can be no ſuch thing; therefore

For any appointments of other things, in, about, or relating to the Worſhip of God, we are not here diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor was the Queſtion ſtated, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to them.</p>
               <p n="13">13. It is raſhly (if no worſe) ſaid, <hi>That there can be no Publick Worſhip or Religion according to that Poſition.</hi> For it plainly inferreth, That in the Churches of God in <hi>Scotland, Holland, France, New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c. there is no <hi>Publick Religion</hi> or <hi>VVorship;</hi> for it is certain that in all, or moſt of them, there are <hi>no Forms of Prayer <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally uſed or impoſed,</hi> tho there be in ſome of them, ſome made and left at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to be uſed or not uſed.</p>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105665:83"/> their commands enjoyned all the Jews to bring none but <hi>Turtle Doves?</hi> Or none but <hi>Young Pigeons of another kind?</hi> Or what preſident there is in Scripture of any <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical or Civil power,</hi> that ever arrogated and aſſumed ſuch a liberty, or declared that they judged ſuch a thing lawful? This I think ſufficient to have ſpoken to what our <hi>Anſwerer</hi> ſaith as to the firſt <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. The Second <hi>Queſtion</hi> was <hi>about the Superiors power of commanding in Religious Acts.</hi> A grave and weighty Queſtion, an Agreement in which will bring us to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent iſſue as to all our Religious differences. Let us ſee what our <hi>Vindicator</hi> will grant in the caſe. He tells us p. 185.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That if any Inferior, or any perſon whatſoever, accounteth any thing to be forbidden, <hi>proceeding upon any good and true grounds,</hi> no ſuch thing may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, being in it ſelf evil, whether the Superior think it not neceſſary or by a miſtake thinks it neceſſary.</q> We thank him for this, it is enough for us, nor ſhall we need repeat any thing more he hath in this Chapter ſaid. I have onely this Queſtion to ask, <hi>Who, as to the Inferiors Practice, muſt judg, whether the Inferiors judgment proceedeth upon juſt and true grounds.</hi> Let us but have this point freely and clearly ſpoken to. If he ſaith the Superior muſt judge, all this is juſt nothing, for thoſe Superiors muſt be prodigiouſly wicked, that ſhall command
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105665:84"/> their Inferiours to do that, which they judge the Inferiors upon good and true grounds judge unlawful. This were for him to command things, which he knew to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p n="17">17. If he ſaith (as he muſt do if he will maintain the Religion of Proteſtants) That tho the <hi>Superior</hi> be the <hi>judge</hi> of the <hi>lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>unlawfulneſs of his commands, ſo far as concerneth his own Act in commanding; yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Inferiour muſt judge of the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of his Act, in obeying, and the truth and falſhood of the grounds upon which he proceeds.</hi> It is what we hold and agree in.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But ſtill the true <hi>Queſtion</hi> remains, upon ſuppoſition, That the <hi>Superior</hi> and <hi>Inferiour</hi> differ in their <hi>Aprehenſions</hi> of a thing, the <hi>Superiour</hi> thinking upon ſuch as he thinks <hi>good</hi> and <hi>true grounds,</hi> that the thing is <hi>lawful,</hi> The Inferior judging upon (what he thinks) true and good grounds, that it is <hi>unlawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether the Superior can command his Inferiors ſuch things in the VVorship of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Qu.</note> 
                  <hi>which he judgeth not neceſſary from the Light of Nature,</hi> or <hi>Revealed Will of God, and the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or judgeth ſinful and what he may not do.</hi> So then there are two things we yield in the caſe.</p>
               <p n="19">19. That as to things which are meerly <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>ſecular,</hi> the Magiſtrate may command what he judgeth <hi>neceſſary,</hi> or
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105665:84"/> 
                  <hi>expedient,</hi> for the <hi>ends of his Government?</hi> of which things, he hath no <hi>Judge</hi> (ſave God alone) <hi>Superior</hi> to him, and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour</hi> muſt obey him, where <hi>Gods Will</hi> doth not plainly controul; and if it doth controul him, he muſt patiently ſuffer the penalty for not doing them; for his <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conſcience</hi> is no <hi>Judge</hi> of theſe things further then as to his own practice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be contrary to the Rule of Gods Word or no.</p>
               <p n="20">20. That as to things of a more <hi>Spiritual Nature,</hi> which concern the <hi>Worſhip of God,</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is bound to command, what he, after diligent inquiry into the law of God, judgeth <hi>neceſſary;</hi> that is commanded by God in his Word: and to forbid, what he judgeth there forbidden, and in theſe things the <hi>Inferiour</hi> is bound to obey. If in theſe things he judgeth diverſly from his Superiour, he cannot do the things, but muſt patiently ſuffer, and the matter in difference muſt be by God determined at the laſt day, where the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> (tho it then appears he was in a miſtake) may hope for Mercy, becauſe he did what he did, in the integrity of his heart, provided he neglected not due means for finding out of the Will of God, nor in his <hi>Puniſhment for diſobedience,</hi> exceeded the Rules of Scripture, and right Reaſon, and Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="21">21. But we do not think, that in the Worſhip of God, eſpecially as to the <hi>Acts, Parts,</hi> or <hi>Means</hi> of it (thoſe being things
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105665:85"/> of the truth or falſhood of which the Will of God alone can determine, and which he hath ſufficiently determined in his Word.) The Superior without ſin, can command, what himſelf doth not from the will of God judge <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but he knoweth the <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> judgeth to be <hi>ſinful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe he hath no power in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding things of this nature, more then the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> had, who had no power to bind up all the Iſraelites to bring Turtle Doves, when Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription had left them at liberty, either to bring them, or young Pidgeons; nor was ever any ſuch power aſſumed by Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates under the ordinary Circumſtances of Magiſtrates (that is being no Prophets, and divinely inſpired, as were <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>) who both were Pen-men of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe ſuch commands muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be for <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> not for <hi>Aedification,</hi> and the Apoſtle declared he had no ſuch power, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. ſuch commands muſt neceſſarily be againſt <hi>Charity,</hi> tending to deſtroy Peoples Souls.</p>
               <p n="22">22. But as to this, our <hi>Vindicator</hi> tells us, <q>That real Charity providing for the good and profit of the Souls of Men, is of far greater value, then that which I call Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity gratifying and complying with men in their miſtakes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How properly this is ſpoken, and how prettily the Queſtion here begged, let
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105665:85"/> any ordinary Reader judge; was not I arguing for the good and profit of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Souls and Bodies too? That which I call Charity is what the Apoſtle calls ſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15. <hi>If thy Brother be grieved with thy Meat</hi> (which thou mayeſt eat, or let alone) <hi>now walkeſt thou not charitably</hi> (that is in eating and ſo giving him occaſion to ſin) <hi>deſtroy not him with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y meat, for whom Chriſt dyed.</hi> Can any Divine think that God in that Text hath not ſaid to all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, in the matters relating to my Worſhip, make not him to ſin by thy commands, which thou mayeſt or mayeſt not (as thou thinkeſt) at thy pleaſure give out, for whom Chriſt dyed.</p>
               <p n="23">23. I appeal now to all rational and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent perſons, whether the <hi>Vindicator</hi> or I, have ſpoken here moſt ſenſe and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies as to the matter in Queſtion, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Forms of Prayer in the publick Miniſtry,</hi> may be univerſally <hi>uſed or impoſed.</hi> This is all which I can find in this Chapter of our <hi>Vindicator</hi> worth any notice as to the Queſtion in hand; for what is ſpoken, as to other <hi>Rites, Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>Geſtures,</hi> the lawfulneſs, or unlawfulneſs of them, it doth not concern our preſent purpoſe. Let us firſt have done with this <hi>ſingle Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and then we will if he pleaſeth, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe other things; in the mean time I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to ſwell a Book with Diſcourſes <hi>De Omni Ente.</hi> Beſides it may be, that by our cloſe diſcourſe upon this Queſtion, we

Our Vindicators Principles in this Chapter ſeem to be, 1. <hi>That words in Vocal Miniſterial Prayer,</hi> are <hi>neither parts nor means in that Worſhip.</hi> 2. That <hi>Superiors may determine whatever he judgeth God hath left at liberty in his Worſhip, though the</hi> Inferior <hi>thinks they are not there left at liberty.</hi> I am not of his mind.</p>

                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:105665:88"/> of things in Gods Worſhip, muſt be concluded from a <hi>preceeding Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God.</hi> No <hi>Act, Part</hi> or <hi>Mean</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> is uſeful, which God hath not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Light of Nature or in his Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Will.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As to what he tells me, p. 194. n. 4. I anſwer, That no good Chriſtian can yield a <hi>Reverence to Superiors,</hi> where he cannot ſave his <hi>Reverence to God,</hi> in the firſt place; and that he cannot do, till he be ſatisfied, that his <hi>Superior</hi> is his <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> in that caſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> That God hath given him a power to command and to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him in the caſe, if it be the Will of God, that another <hi>Mean</hi> ſhould be uſed in that caſe, by thoſe that have it; Or if it be the Will of God, that as to any Act of Worſhip a mean ſhould be left to his Peoples liberty as under the Law it was in caſe of the <hi>Turtle Doves, or young Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> before named. It is no <hi>Reverence</hi> to, but a ſinful flattering of Superiors, to tell them by our Tongues, Pens or Practice, that they may appoint ſuch means, as God hath not appointed, or that they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point and determine where it is the <hi>Will of God</hi> that his Miniſters or People ſhould be left at liberty. And Chriſtians ought not to yield <hi>Principles,</hi> which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable againſt them, to carry them on to further ſins.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But in the next place he comes to conſider, <hi>Whether it be not lawful to forbear
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105665:88"/> Prayers,</hi> (conceived Prayers at leaſt) <hi>before and after Sermons,</hi> he thinks it is. Well then if it be lawful (ſay our <hi>Conformable Divines</hi>) it may be commanded by Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, and ſuch commands ought to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed by <hi>Inferiors.</hi> Then it is true which I ſaid, That Superiors may wholly in Publick Worſhip ſuppreſs the Gift of Prayer.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But what ſhall we ſay for Families? p. 200, <hi>he thinks a well compoſed Form may be uſed in a Family.</hi> I think ſo too, if he that Miniſtreth <hi>hath not the Gift of Prayer,</hi> or if it be a form <hi>compoſed by himſelf.</hi> But the Queſtion is, <hi>VVhether Superiors may command the uſe of ſuch, and no other.</hi> He ſeemeth to conclude they may, for he determineth them <hi>lawful,</hi> and according to the Principle, That Superiors may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand even in the Worſhip of God <hi>what is lawful,</hi> not what is neceſſary only; They may alſo as to Families ſuppreſs the uſe of our Gift of Prayer, or Ability to expreſs our ſelves to God in Prayer. So it is granted, that by a <hi>Superiors command, the Exerciſe of the Miniſterial Gift of Prayer may be ſhut out of all Churches and all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;</hi> and indeed it is ſo as to a great many.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Well then, may we pray otherwiſe then by Forms in our <hi>Cloſet,</hi> admitting Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors did command us alſo there to pray only by Forms? He tells us p. 203. <hi>That
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105665:89"/> Forms of Prayer are of excellent and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar uſe in Families and Cloſets?</hi> But p. 202. he tells us as to Cloſets, <hi>That if any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior should forbid all ſuch Confeſſions and Petitions</hi> [in Cloſets] <hi>this being againſt the duty of a Creature and a Chriſtian, ought not to be ſubmitted to.</hi> So then, the Superior in this caſe is no Superior: But I pray why? Where hath God given the Superior a licence to <hi>determine</hi> the words of <hi>Vocal Prayer</hi> in <hi>one place, more then in another?</hi> I am ſure it is not in Scripture, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive how it ſhould be in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Our Anſwerer offers but one thing in reaſon for it, <hi>Becauſe there are many things concerning the Perſons own particular wants, which cannot be comprized in a Form, are needful matters of his private and retired Devotions;</hi> p. 201. Will not the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hold for leaving Forms of Prayer at liberty to be uſed or not uſed in publick Congregations? What State, what Church almoſt is there, that every Month hath not ſome new particular wants, I will not ſay which cannot be comprized in a Form, but which cannot be comprized in the ſame Form; and if Forms for the <hi>Publick</hi> muſt upon this account be renewed every Moon, why may they not, or ſhould they not, for perſons be renewed every night (that is only matter of trouble.)</p>
               <p n="11">11. Here's one great evil of <hi>ſtanding Forms, they cannot provide for the greateſt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105665:89"/> Emergencies.</hi> Within theſe Two years laſt paſt, we have had as great iſſues of Providence, with reference both to our moſt <hi>Sacred Soveraigns Life, our Religion,</hi> and <hi>Civil Government,</hi> as ever any Nation or Church in the World had: as great things to give God ſpecial thanks and great praiſe for: as great things to begg of God, for our <hi>Bodies,</hi> our <hi>Souls,</hi> our <hi>Poſterity.</hi> What hath there been in all our publick Forms for it? How many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations have there been, where God hath not had one Thankſgiving for ſo great Diſcovery; or one Prayer imploring him either to avert the dangers feared, or his aſſiſtance to our King and Councels for the fuller diſcovery of the wickedneſs, and perfecting our deliverence. I believe ſince Chriſt had a Church upon the Earth and an intereſt in any Kingdom, of the Extent of ours, an inſtance cannot be given, where the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly and without any perſons contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of it, declared,

How much is God either mocked or deprived of his Glory? We have had ſo late and famous an Inſtance, as no more plain one can be.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I laid my fifth Argument thus,
<q>To agree a Principle, which agreed would alſo allow a power in man,<note place="margin">Reaſonable Acco. p. 98.</note> when pleaſed to ſuppreſs all Miniſterial Gifts in Preaching; is ſinful.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to agree, it is lawful for Miniſters to obey Man, in performing their Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Acts in Prayer, by the preſcribed Forms of other Men, is to agree a Principle which agreed, would allow man a power when he pleaſed, to ſuppreſs all Minſterial Gifts in Preaching.</hi> Ergo, The <hi>Major</hi> is evident upon the Principle before laid down, <hi>That it is not in the power of Man to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, extinguiſh or render uſeleſs, any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Gift;</hi> for this were to fruſtrate Chriſts deſign in giving them; which was not to be laid up in Napkins, but to be uſed for the good of Men.

               <p n="3">3.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105665:92"/> of that is this, <hi>Stay till you have condemned your ſelves, and ſhall have nothing to ſay if ſuch a thing</hi> be <hi>commanded</hi> (having firſt granted the Principle on which it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and then <hi>complain,</hi> that is, <hi>When the Steed is ſtollen, ſhut the Stable door;</hi> let us firſt hook you paſt eſcaping us without rending your jaws, and then if we catch <hi>you</hi> and pull you up, complain. Every wiſe man ought to conſider whither his <hi>Principles</hi> or Practice will <hi>carry him,</hi> before he alloweth the one, or ingageth in the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Next he tells us, <hi>That he hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, the ordinary and conſtant uſefulneſs of Set Forms in Prayer, in Publick Worſhip, for the advantage of Religion, if I be able to prove the ſame concerning the ordinary uſing the diſcourſes of others in preaching, he hath then, and not till then made the Caſes parallel; but this he thinks I never can.</hi> Let me try a little. I remember p. 87, 88, he hath given us a ſummary of theſe pretended advantages.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To aſcertain the people, that nothing ſhall be prayed for by the Miniſters, but what they can ſay Amen</hi> to. And is it not as great an advantage from Forms of Sermons, that then the People ſhall hear nothing, but what they may afore-hand conſider, and be aſſured they may by <hi>Faith</hi> agree to?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the people might be under no Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to give their minds a liberty for ill

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105665:93"/> better than we, what would be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to Religion: There's no arguing in theſe caſes, but concerning the <hi>Will</hi> of God in the caſe. They are not our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied advantages, that will prove the Will of God in theſe caſes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the next place he tells us, The <hi>Ancient Church appointed Forms of Prayer, but not Forms of Sermons.</hi> Admit this were true, that the <hi>Ancients</hi> for 500 years after Chriſt did either generally uſe, or <hi>impoſe Forms</hi> of Prayer, (which I am very far from believing to have any truth in it) and not Forms of Sermons; doth this prove that the one is more lawful then the other? Are the Opinions and Practices of Men, things to be urged argumentatively to prove a thing <hi>Lawful</hi> or Sinful? They may be urged indeed to put us upon a ſtrict Enquity, but no further. I may conſider theſe differences, when I believe the thing is true in matter of fact; but I ſhall never ſo conſider them, if I knew the thing was true, as to determine lawfulneſs, or ſin from them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>But Preaching is directed to Men</hi> (therefore there muſt be no impoſing Forms as to that) but <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>God</hi> (therefore <hi>Forms</hi> may be appointed as to that.) Can any Mortal underſtand, why there ſhould be more care taken, what a Miniſter ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in <hi>mans name unto God,</hi> then in <hi>Gods Name unto Man?</hi> Hath not an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor more reaſon to take care what he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105665:94"/> in the Princes, name unto People, then what, and how he ſpeaketh, in ordinary Petitioners name unto his Prince? But Men may be taken with <hi>varying of Phraſes,</hi> but <hi>God cannot.</hi> But God may be pleaſed I hope with the doing of his Will, and by the exerciſes of thoſe Abilities in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which he hath given us on purpoſe for that <hi>Service;</hi> and it ſpeaketh no great <hi>Reverence for God,</hi> for any to expreſs theſe things by the <hi>Puerile</hi> expreſſion of <hi>Varying Phraſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The next thing he ſaith p. 208, is very admirable, That <hi>Erroneous Notions</hi> and <hi>Practices, cannot be ſo well beaten down</hi> by <hi>Forms,</hi> as by <hi>every Miniſters Abilities.</hi> This is to ſay that Errors may be better confuted, and Arguments for them better anſwered by any Miniſters private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and Expreſſions on a ſmall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation, then by a Book or Forms, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately by many compoſed and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; for Forms may be made every Month of this nature, if they be lawful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He tells us thirdly, p. 209. <hi>That by leaving men to the uſe of their own abilities, in Preaching, Miniſters may acquaint Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with ſuch things as are ſuitable to them, and in a Phraſe ſuitable:</hi> It is much, that he could not conſider alſo, that if Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were left to pray by their own Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, they might alſo pray to God for ſuch things as new <hi>Emergencies</hi> make need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:105665:94"/> for them; which they can never do by <hi>Forms,</hi> except they were renewed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Week.

               <p>The Articles of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> are yet more plain, Artic. 34, 35, 36, 37. I ſhall only mention one clauſe Art. 34.</p>
               <q>This Righteouſneſs which we receive of Gods Mercy, and Chriſts Merits, imbraced by Faith (which Faith Artic. 37 they declare to be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Application of the Promiſes of the Goſpel, to the comfort of our Souls, whereby we lay hold an Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is taken, accepted and allowed of by God, for our perfect and full Juſtification.</q>
               <p n="17">17. Our Anſwerer knew well enough that by <hi>imputed Righteouſneſs</hi> we did never underſtand, that the <hi>Acts or Sufferings</hi> of Chriſt as <hi>Mediator</hi> were imputed, ſo as to make them as if we had done them. This

                  <hi>(Reader)</hi> is juſt ſuch another Argument, as if a <hi>Prince</hi> ſhould employ his <hi>Embaſſadour</hi> to pay a <hi>Redemption Price</hi> for an 100 Slaves at <hi>Algiers,</hi> and he ſhould do according to his Commiſſion; and when he had done, ſome learned <hi>Muſſelman,</hi> ſhould come to prove that the <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> Action in Payment of the <hi>Ranſome,</hi> could not be reckoned his, or as if <hi>he had done it,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a <hi>Mediator</hi> for an 100, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he actually pay the money.

It gives <hi>Chriſt no place in Mans Redemption,</hi> but that of <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> a <hi>Covenant</hi> upon which God might exerciſe his Grace.

Much more might be ſaid: In ſhort, it alloweth Chriſt to be a <hi>great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> a great <hi>Benefactor to</hi> Man-kind, but denies him to be a <hi>True Prieſt,</hi> ſuch a one as <hi>atones by Blood;</hi> he onely doth it by <hi>Mediation, Interceſſion,</hi> and a <hi>Covenant.</hi> According to this Doctrine, his Blood on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſealed a Covenant; in what ſenſe they call his Death a Sacrifice, they know beſt.</p>
               <p n="21">21. In the mean time, no ſober perſons deny <hi>good works</hi> their due place; without them no Soul <hi>ſhall be juſtified in the great day.</hi> They are neceſſary to Salvation, and

But they have no place in the <hi>juſtification of a Soul in this Life,</hi> unleſs in the <hi>Juſtification of its Faith,</hi> to be true, and not counterfeit. And a Soul may be declared Righteous before God, and have its ſins pardoned, before it hath actually done any good works, tho not before it be prepared by God for them by a <hi>diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrought by Gods holy Spirit in the heart,</hi> and a <hi>reſolution</hi> to do them; which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Repentance</hi> in the Seed, but ſuch a Seed as muſt neceſſarily afterwards produce its Fruit. For it is as impoſſible any Soul ſhould truly truſt and hope in Chriſt for that Eternal Life which he hath only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to an Holy Life, and not live ſuch a life; as it is that a man or woman ſhould truly truſt and hope in a rich man for an Eſtate, without doing the things to the performance of which he hath made the promiſe; which is even naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any to do, tho they may pretend to it.</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:105665:102"/> others to the conduct of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. Nor had I done this, if the World had not been ſo often, and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently told, That we grant theſe things <hi>lawful,</hi> That <hi>we have no reaſons,</hi> nothing to ſay (Wiſdome, Reaſon, and Learning, were all born with them, and with them alone they muſt dwell and dye.)

                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:105665:103"/>4. But at length our Vindicator thinks he ſhall ſpeak to the point, telling us, That <hi>there is not the ſame reaſon to interpret the precept of Preaching, as the precepts for Prayer.</hi> Very good, why did not he ſay ſo at firſt; I do think there is, how doth he prove there is not? He ſaith (inſtead of <hi>every precept is to be interpreted) every duty is to be performed, ſuitably to the Nature of the Duty it ſelf, or in ſuch a manner as may beſt tend to the pleaſing of God, and the exerciſe of true Piety.</hi> Very true, it being always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that thoſe things <hi>beſt pleaſe God,</hi> and are the trueſt <hi>exerciſes of Piety, which are according to his will.</hi> For to talk in matters of <hi>External Worſhip,</hi> of any thing <hi>pleaſing to God, being an Exerciſe of Piety,</hi> or any vertue in them antecedent to, or <hi>ſeparate</hi> from the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> is very odd diſcourſe. God hath not willed acts in <hi>External Worſhip,</hi> becauſe they are good and pious, but becauſe he hath willed them, therefore they are ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> he tells us, That in <hi>Publick Prayer, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Devotion</hi> and <hi>Gracious Diſpoſitions and Deſires towards God, are the great things to be practiſed, and to that end the uſe of a Form is well accommodated.</hi> I ſuppoſe he means for all Miniſters, for otherwiſe he ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We are ſpeaking (as I ſaid at firſt) not of Prayer in the general, but of <hi>Vocal Prayer</hi> of which (as I have proved) words are an <hi>Eſſential Part;</hi> and being ſo, our
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105665:103"/> Author hath told us, <hi>None but God can inſtitute</hi> what words we ſhall uſe. If he hath appointed any <hi>Forms</hi> of this Nature, they are therefore <hi>lawful</hi> and beſt, becauſe he hath appointed them. If he hath left us ſome, but not commanded us to uſe them; but leaving us at liberty to uſe them, or others to that ſenſe; Man can no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, then in the caſe of the <hi>Turtle Doves</hi> or young <hi>Pigeons.</hi> If he hath only <hi>Inſtituted words</hi> as <hi>a part of Vocal Prayer,</hi> but left it to the liberty of his Miniſters what words to uſe, only requiring them to ask nothing contrary to his <hi>Revealed Will;</hi> it is not in the Creatures power to determine to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other what words he ſhould uſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Two <hi>Errors</hi> and no ſmall ones, I have obſerved running through all our <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicators</hi> Book. He ſeems not to allow of <hi>Vocal Prayer</hi> to be a diſtinct <hi>ſpecies of Prayer,</hi> from what is <hi>meerly Mental,</hi> which it muſt be, or it would be ſufficient for a Miniſter in the publick Congregation to Pray Mentally, and 2. <hi>Prayer</hi> would be no Homage of our Lipps, and outward man. And if it be, there is ſomething elſe required to it, beſides <hi>Gracious Diſpoſitions</hi> and <hi>Deſires towards God,</hi> viz. Audible <hi>words,</hi> and they muſt be an <hi>Eſſential part</hi> of it, as being that which alone diſtinguiſheth it from the other <hi>Species.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Secondly, Our Author all along this diſcourſe, ſeemeth to talk of a <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> in <hi>External Worſhip,</hi> anteceda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105665:104"/> to the <hi>Will of God</hi> revealed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Worſhip.</hi> Hence he thinks to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Forms according to the Will of God,</hi> becauſe (in his opinion) they tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> yea and pleads theſe things in barr to our proof, that <hi>It is the Will of God that his Miniſters who have the Gift of Prayer, or an Ability fitly to expreſs their minds to God in Prayer, ſhould uſe that Gift in Praying.</hi> We think that that Duty in External Worſhip which is performed moſt ſtrictly <hi>according to the Will of God,</hi> is performed with moſt <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Piety;</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have more to ſay for their <hi>Images</hi> then I think they have.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But he further addeth, <hi>That Miniſters are to teach People what they before underſtood not.</hi> This is in part true, but this is not half their work in Preaching. <hi>We are not to acquaint God in Prayer with what he before knew not.</hi> Therefore the precept for Preaching may not be interpreted <hi>go and read another Mans Sermon;</hi> but the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for Prayer</hi> may be interpreted, <hi>go read another Mans Prayer.</hi> We cannot indeed in Prayer tell God what he is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: But how doth it therefore follow that therefore we muſt not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the precept of God as to Miniſterial Prayer, <hi>Go, and ſtudy the Mind and Will of God, and according to the Abilities I have given you, expreſs your and others thoughts to me, as to the things which are according
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:105665:104"/> to my Will;</hi> ſeeing it may be done by words conceived in our own hearts, and I have proved them moſt <hi>Natural,</hi> moſt <hi>proper</hi> and very probably <hi>the Will of God;</hi> and conſidering <hi>words</hi> are an <hi>Eſſential part of this Worſhip</hi> which no Man can <hi>inſtitute</hi> or determine, if Gods Word hath left the particular words to our liberty, and that the matter of Prayer is more variable then of Sermons?</p>
               <p n="9">9. I had ſaid p. 118, <hi>That the words in both Languages in Scripture uſed to expreſs</hi> Reading, <hi>are quite other, from thoſe uſed to expreſs our duty in Prayer.</hi> — In the ſame page I had repeated the ſame: <hi>We will not be too confident of it, but we are not aware of any Text in the Old Teſtament where</hi>

But I did not remember any text in which <gap reason="foreign">

But then I ſhould be exclaimed againſt by our <hi>Vindicator</hi> as a great <hi>Slanderer</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> though I know (if our Vindicator doth not) that the Biſhops cannot help it. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to mourn for, and to throw out in thoſe times any <hi>ſottiſh Perſons,</hi> that by their Hypocriſie in thoſe times crept into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, when they once appeared ſo, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called them <hi>the Brethren</hi> or <hi>our Brethren,</hi> but look'd upon them as the <hi>Scabs</hi> and <hi>Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Church.</hi> For their <hi>Abilities,</hi> there was no defect of <hi>Tryal of them</hi> in any <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Ordinations,</hi> that hath been amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince.

               <p n="7">7. Our <hi>Vindicator</hi> p. 231, 232, 233, 234 ſpends many words to prove that God did under the Law annex a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Revenue to thoſe that were his Officers, tho their work was none other, then what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons had a natural capacity to do.</hi> But 1.

               <p n="1">1. That Gods Proviſion for the Prieſts, was a Proviſion for a whole Tribe in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.

               <p n="2">2. It was not reaſonable that their Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſhould be leſs then was aſſigned to the other Tribes: but more, becauſe they were taken off from other means of live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-hood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their imployment took up their full time.</p>
               <p>I will not examine how great it was,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:105665:109"/> but doth our Anſwerer think that it is a good Argument to conclude (if he could do it) that becauſe God under the <hi>legal diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> allotted a great Maintenance to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons meerly for doing what any ordinary people could have done (which yet is not ſo) and becauſe they were one of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> no otherwiſe provided for; that therefore under the Goſpel, where that Worſhip is wholly altered, and a new <hi>Worſhip</hi> inſtituted, for one part of which the great Apoſtle cries out, <hi>Who is ſufficient,</hi> that God ſhould erect a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Order of Men, and lay ſuch ſevere charges upon them, <hi>to give attendance to Reading, Exhortation, and Doctrine, not to neglect their Gift,</hi> to <hi>Meditate on Divine things, and give themſelves up wholly to them,</hi> to <hi>take heed unto their Doctrine, to Preach the Word, to be inſtant in Seaſon and out of Seaſon, to Reprove, Rebuke, Exhort,</hi> to <hi>make Interceſſions, Supplications, Prayers, and to give Thanks for all Men,</hi> &amp;c.

Will that Maxime, The Labourer is <hi>worthy of his Hire,</hi> the <hi>Workman of his Wages,</hi> prove that thoſe who do no work in the Miniſtry, ſhould have Wages?

                  <p>A Reply to the <hi>Vindicators 9</hi> Chap. p. <hi>241,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Vindicators</hi> Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>10</hi> Arguments for <hi>Forms of Prayer</hi> before battered, beaten down, and himſelf proved to have alledged no reaſon in his five Reaſons, cogent for the general uſe and impoſition of Forms.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. I took notice of Ten Arguments brought for ſuch Forms of Prayer, and ſuch an uſe of them, as I had been ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
               <p>The firſt was, <hi>becauſe Forms are not by God forbidden.</hi> p. 135, I told them, They were forbidden, by the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and three ſorts of Texts more. He tells us, He hath anſwered before all I ſaid to juſtifie this. So I have anſwered now all that he hath ſaid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He Vindicates the Second Argument mentioned by me from my Anſwer to it, in the ſame manner. I in like manner ſay, What he hath ſaid in his <hi>Vindication</hi> to thoſe purpoſes, I have anſwered before, in this my <hi>Reply</hi> to his <hi>Vindication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To their third Argument from the common Topicks of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency,</hi> I
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:105665:116"/> anſwered <hi>Order</hi> onely <hi>reſpects firſt and laſt:</hi> he thinks <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth more. It is hard to prove: but be it ſo; In Divine Worſhip, nothing is <hi>Order</hi> but <hi>what God hath preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>his Word.</hi> As to <hi>Decency,</hi> I had told him nothing was <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> but that whoſe contrary is <hi>Indecent:</hi> for betwixt <hi>Decency</hi> and Indecency there is no <hi>Medium participationis.</hi> He denieth this, and thinks to prove it, becauſe <hi>white</hi> and <hi>black</hi> are contraries; yet a <hi>white Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> may be <hi>Decent,</hi> and a <hi>black Garment not Indecent.</hi> But doth he think that it is good arguing from <hi>Accidents</hi> to Subſtances, or amongſt <hi>Accidents</hi> from <hi>Quantities</hi> to <hi>Actions?</hi> Surely he ſhould have inſtanced in ſome <hi>Actions</hi> in Gods Worſhip, which are both <hi>Decent</hi> and <hi>Indecent</hi> at the ſame time. He doth not like I ſhould ſay, That <hi>Forms are no circumſtances relating to the Action of Prayer, as it is a meer humane Act, becauſe it migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> be performed without them;</hi> why? Becauſe <hi>ſtanding</hi> or <hi>any other geſture, is a Circumſtance,</hi> and <hi>ſome geſture is alwaies neceſſary.</hi> So <hi>words</hi> are neceſſary to all <hi>Vocal Prayer,</hi> but yet <hi>Forms of Words</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by others are not ſo. Though <hi>ſtanding</hi> or any <hi>other geſture</hi> be a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, yet I hope a <hi>particular geſture</hi> is no neceſſary Circumſtance of Prayer, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meerly as an humane Act. He tells us again, <hi>There can be no publick P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>er with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any words, nor unleſs the words be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by ſome.</hi> Both theſe things are true,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:105665:117"/> but nothing to the purpoſe; for our queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is about forms of words, prepared by others: and if (as he ſaith truly) <hi>there can be no Prayer in Publick without words,</hi> then words are a <hi>part of that Worſhip</hi> (they are the Homage of the Lipps and outward Man) the <hi>External Part</hi> of that Worſhip, muſt be words, and no <hi>part of Worſhip</hi> may be preſcribed by man. He ſaith true, <hi>the words muſt be determined</hi> by ſome body. God hath left them to the liberty of his Miniſters determination, and what God hath ſo left at liberty, is the Miniſters <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> and priviledge. I ſhewed before that Man muſt not determine in the <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> of Worſhip, what he hath left at liberty; ſo that they may (acceptably to him) do this or that: whether this be <hi>trifling,</hi> let the <hi>Reader</hi> judge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He hath ſaid nothing to take off my Argument to the fourth Argument, but what I have before taken off, he is again at it,</hi>
                  <q> That no pious man can think that the Will and Pleaſure of God, is, that mens abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ſhould be exerciſed meerly to ſhew their parts.</q> All the ſtrength lies in <hi>meerly,</hi> the falſhood and vanity of which ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I have ſufficiently before ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I ſhall ſay nothing to what he ſaith to take off my anſwer to the Argument, from the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2. becauſe our <hi>Vindicator</hi> himſelf will not ſay it is <hi>concluſive</hi> in the caſe. I do not think it <hi>probable,</hi> nor the more <hi>probable,</hi> becauſe of the general uſe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:105665:117"/> of them in the <hi>earlieſt</hi> ages of Chriſtianity, which I do not believe either proved, or capable of proof.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In his p. 247, 248. he comes to take off what I had ſaid to the 7th Objection, <hi>That Superiors may determine us to whatſoever we may determine our ſelves.</hi> He will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg this not to be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally</hi> true. Two caſes he excepts. 1. <hi>When the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors commands take away the juſt civil rights and freedoms of the Subjects.</hi> Saith he ſo? May not the Superior determine me, in a caſe where I may determine my ſelf, if his determination takes away my Civil Rights? And may he determine me in a caſe, where my Spiritual Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties are concerned, and therein may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine my ſelf? Oh how cheap are Mens Spiritual Rights and Liberties in the eyes of ſome, and that in matters, where their Souls are ſo highly concerned in their <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt in their liberties?</hi> Are Civil Rights more to be contended for then Spiritual Rights? And may they be contended for againſt a Civil Superior (tho they be in matters which are his proper Sphere) and may not Spiritual Liberties be contended for, which we derive immediately from God, and of which no Magiſtrate as to my practice is under God the proximate judge? 2. His other caſe is, <hi>Where the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded is againſt the Rules of Conſcience,</hi> But ſurely every man in ſuch things is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and hath no power to determine

I had told him that the <hi>ſecurity he talked of was</hi> not <hi>poſſible,</hi> nor <hi>attainable by Forms.</hi> He tells me it muſt be <hi>ſecured</hi> as <hi>much as may be</hi> (that is his ſenſe) but I hope not by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving Miniſters of the juſt liberty and rights which Chriſt hath left them, not by making Miniſters, the <hi>Miniſters of Men,</hi> to read what they have preſcribed, inſtead of the <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> doing his work
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:105665:121"/> by the means he hath in <hi>Nature</hi> and by Scripture directed. 3. I told him that in <hi>Hundreds of Congregations, for twenty years together,</hi> the Worſhip of God was in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> well, and orderly performed <hi>without Forms.</hi> I here add, and hath been, and is in <hi>Scotland,</hi> New <hi>England, Holland,</hi> ſo as admit what he ſaith were true in the late times of all the Congregations in <hi>England,</hi> (which it is very far from) yet there is proof enough, ro overthrow his Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="11">11. His ſecond reaſon was, <hi>That needful and comprehenſive Petitions, for all Spiritual and outward wants, with fit Thanksgivings, may not in the publick Supplications of the Church be Omited;</hi> when as the tying of all men to the Forms, is the ready way to have them <hi>Omitted,</hi> as we have had now the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of two years laſt paſt, for a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proof; nor are the <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wants</hi> of Chriſtians, proportionable to the particular renewing wants of States and Churches, Congregations, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="12">12. His <hi>Third Reaſon</hi> was, <hi>That the hearts of Pious Men, might be more devout, and better united in the Service of God, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering before-hand what Prayers and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, they are to offer up,</hi> and <hi>come the more ready to joyn and prepared to joyn in them.</hi> And when they come, not hear one word about the particular Sins, they have been thinking to confeſs, but onely ſins in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; nor of their preſent and renewing
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:105665:121"/> wants, nor of their lately received mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, how great ſoever they be, nor how Univerſal ſoever, for which God certainly expects a particular <hi>Recognition</hi> and <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving;</hi> but onely words of <hi>General Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,</hi> for all Mercies, and <hi>general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions</hi> of all <hi>Sins,</hi> and <hi>general Petitions</hi> for all good things.</p>
               <p n="13">13. He ſeems diſpleaſed that I should tell him, <hi>Forms may</hi> be read <hi>falſly.</hi> This he ſaith is very <hi>unlike,</hi> but I my ſelf with a hundred more, have heard it more then once; I could name him the <hi>particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, times</hi> and <hi>things,</hi> but then I ſhould be exclaimed againſt again for reflecting, yet it is not yet 14 days ſince I heard it from one, who (as one would have thought) read the Forms with great Zeal. But then he ſaith the people may <hi>help themſelves,</hi> having <hi>often heard and joyned in the Form;</hi> that is, provided they have the moſt by heart, which not one hath of Ten thouſand; and 2. then not without great diſtraction, for they have great reaſon to believe, their <hi>Leader</hi> can <hi>Read</hi> more <hi>perfectly</hi> then they can remember.</p>
               <p n="12">12. His fourth Reaſon was, <q>
                     <hi>That ſuch difficult parts of Church Offices as</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Supper of the Lord, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which requires great conſideration, may in compoſing a Form be ſo framed, that men of greateſt underſtandings may with readieſt aſſent, entertain them, and that they might be ſufficiently Vindicated <hi>(from the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:105665:122"/> Calumny I ſuppoſe he means)</hi> of the boldeſt Oppoſers.</q> My Anſwer was to that ſenſe, That theſe were the eaſieſt parts of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Office, as to External work, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the uſe of his Natural Motions of his his hands, he had nothing to do but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the words of our Saviour, which are very ſhort Forms, of Divine Inſtitution, and to apply the general acts of his Office, <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Exhortation</hi> to that Work. This now our <hi>Vindicator</hi> denieth not, but he would have ſecurity, that men ſhould not <hi>Vary.</hi> Let him have a Law with all our hearts: But he rhinks that according to mens different Notions, they may vary in their <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Exhortations.</hi> So they may in their <hi>Sermons,</hi> before the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and what help for that.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>His laſt Reaſon was thus delivered,</hi> 
                  <q>That this may be an Evidence to other Churches in future times, after what way we Worſhip God, <hi>and</hi> that ſuch a Church is in its meaſure a pure and incorrupt Church.</q> I anſwered where hath God required ſuch an Evidence? He tells me, <hi>We need not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpecial command for every good thing.</hi> Nor need every <hi>good thing</hi> be brought into <hi>Publick Worſhip,</hi> and made a part of it. I always took the recital of the <hi>Creed</hi> to be a good thing, but no <hi>Part of Worſhip,</hi> and thus himſelf anſwers what I next ſaid. That to this end <hi>Forms of Sermons are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo needful,</hi> on this Account. I told him a publick <hi>Confeſſion of Faith is a ſufficient Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:105665:122"/> He tells us it is ſo <hi>as to our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> but <hi>not as to our Worſhip:</hi> Well let the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And now I am come to an end of my long journey, where I have not been tyred with the length of my way, but for want of one <hi>Stile</hi> or <hi>Difficulty,</hi> to give my hand or pen the leaſt ſtop.

               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:105665:124"/> (which in <hi>Vocal Prayer, words</hi> muſt be) nor when God hath preſcribed <hi>One Mean</hi> in <hi>Worſhip,</hi> to <hi>direct another;</hi> nor yet <hi>when God hath commanded us to ſerve him with the utmoſt Attention and Fervency;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>to uſe all means</hi> he hath given us in order to that end, can any command of men, limit us to a <hi>Mean,</hi> which we upon experience find, hinders our <hi>Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and Fervency; nor yet when he hath in any duty <hi>promiſed the influence of his Holy Spirit, can Man command any ſuch mode of performance of that duty, as muſt neceſſarily ſhut it out;</hi> which muſt be in the preſent caſe, if any influence of the Holy Spirit upon our <hi>Words</hi> in <hi>Prayer,</hi> be any part of his promiſe.

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:105665:125"/>2. But yet as the moſt of Men, ſo I my ſelf have a great <hi>Reverence</hi> for things that can be made out to be <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Traditions.</hi> Of which nature I hardly know any thing not plainly revealed in Scripture, except the obſervation of the <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath,</hi> and <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> neither of which ſtand upon that ſingle foot; much leſs do I think, that there is any ſuch thing to be pleaded, for <hi>Miniſters <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal porformance of their Miniſterial Acts in Solemn Prayer, by the preſcribed Forms of other Men.</hi> Though therefore enough is ſaid, partly in the <hi>Reaſonable Account,</hi> partly in the <hi>Supplement,</hi> to anſwer whatſoever hath been ſaid of this nature, yet having my pen yet in my hand, I ſhall add a few lines, to juſtifie what is before ſaid, againſt the <hi>Attaques</hi> upon it, and to ſhew the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of what is brought a-new in the <hi>Vindication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Only becauſe we are ſo apt to vary from the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> I deſire the <hi>Reader</hi> would firſt conſider what we do not deny, and therefore needeth no proof. 1. We deny not but from the beginning <hi>Publick Prayers Were made by the Miniſter and Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> 2. We alſo believe, That very early the uſe of the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> was <hi>general</hi> in the <hi>publick Congregations;</hi> tho we find none enjoyned it under Penalties. 3. We do believe, <hi>That even from the firſt there were Orders Set for Churches meeting together</hi> for <hi>Prayers,</hi> in <hi>certain places,</hi> and <hi>certain times.</hi> 4. Nor do we at all doubt but from the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:105665:125"/> beginning, many good Men in imitation of <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Forms of Words,</hi> which might inſtruct the weaker in the due <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Prayer;</hi> which <hi>forms</hi> alſo ſome particular men (not having attained to an Ability fitly to expreſs their minds to God in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick) might uſe, or let alone, as they ſaw reaſon. But none of theſe touch the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is, <hi>Whether Miniſters who have an Ability fitly to expreſs their mind to God in Prayer, may ordinarily without ſin, uſe the preſcribed Forms of other Men?</hi> This our <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator</hi> muſt prove. In order to the proof of it, he ſuggeſteth, <hi>That they have been uſed in all Ages in the Church, and it is unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble therefore to think them not lawful,</hi> or <hi>that they any way hinder Devotion.</hi> Now to make this good, every one ſeeth that (I will not ſay an Univerſal, but) a <hi>general uſe</hi> of them muſt be proved. For if ſome particular men did uſe ſuch of their own accord, it proveth nothing; we agree they may do ſo ſtill.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I cannot ſee how this is capable of proof, for it is very <hi>unreaſonable</hi> to imagine a <hi>general uſe</hi> without a <hi>general Impoſition.</hi> Can any one think, that all, or moſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, for more than 300 years after Chriſt, ſhould fall into a <hi>Practice, to which neither the light of Nature,</hi> nor <hi>any Precept in Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Practice of the Apoſtles, guided them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome command from the Governours</hi> of the Church? This command muſt either be
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:105665:126"/> from all who were <hi>Biſhops over</hi> many Churches, or from all the <hi>Synods of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches,</hi> or from the <hi>Fathers</hi> in ſome <hi>general Council,</hi> or from the <hi>Magiſtrate.</hi> It is certain it was not from the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> for there was no <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrate</hi> till more then 300 years after Chriſt. It could be from no <hi>general Council,</hi> for there was none till 325 years after Chriſt, when the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> Aſſembled. The next was that Aſſembled at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> 380. The next was at <hi>Epheſus</hi> 431. The fourth at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> 451. There is no pretence for any ſuch eſtabliſhment by any <hi>general Council,</hi> till we come to that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> nor there, but by <hi>Implication;</hi> and the probability of that I ſhall examine by and by.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Beſides the <hi>Councils</hi> mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there are 17 <hi>Provincial Synods</hi> we read of before the <hi>Council of Nice,</hi> 36 more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that and the next general <hi>Council at Conſtantinople,</hi> Anno 380. 17 more, before the <hi>General Council at Epheſus,</hi> Anno 431. (12 of which were before that of <hi>Milevis</hi>) 8 more before that of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Anno 451. In all 78 leſſer <hi>Synods,</hi> and 3 <hi>general Councils</hi> were before that of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Of all theſe 78, there are but three pretended to have made any <hi>Canon</hi> in the cauſe. That of <hi>Laodicea</hi> Anno 364, the third <hi>Council of Carthage,</hi> and that of <hi>Milevis</hi> Anno 402; All <hi>Provincial Councils,</hi> whoſe <hi>impoſitions</hi> could reach no further then their own <hi>Provinces;</hi> and I have ſhewed
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:105665:126"/> and ſhall ſhew further, That the firſt decreed no ſuch thing, onely that <hi>Prayers ſhould be in their Churches Mornings and Evenings.</hi> As to that of <hi>Carthage</hi> we have ſhewed that it is doubtful, whether there were ever ſuch a <hi>Council</hi> or no; if there were, it is certain, it made but 21 <hi>Canons,</hi> this is the 23d. Nor do the words of the pretended <hi>Canon</hi> prove any ſuch thing, but rather the contrary. That of <hi>Milevis</hi> indeed is plain, but it was made <hi>upon a particular occaſion,</hi> and reached no further then <hi>Numidia;</hi> and by their aſſuming a power to make a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> for that <hi>Province,</hi> they have told us that there was none made by <hi>Peter, James, Mark, Andrew, Clement,</hi> &amp;c. nor any then of any general uſe in the Church, for if there had, they could eaſilier have directed the keeping to that alone: and it is plain from the words of that <hi>Canon,</hi> that till that time there was a <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>compoſition</hi> left <hi>to the Miniſters of Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. I therefore humbly offer it to my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Readers</hi> obſervation, how impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a proof they undertake, who undertake to prove a <hi>General uſe or impoſition of Forms of Prayers for more then</hi> 400 <hi>years after Chriſt;</hi> being neither able to prove it, from <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Practice</hi> of particular Men, nor from more then one of 78 <hi>Provincial Synods</hi> (and that in a particular caſe of great <hi>Exigence</hi>) nor from any <hi>Canon</hi> of any <hi>General Council,</hi> and I am ſure much leſs from the <hi>commands</hi> of all <hi>particular Biſhops</hi> in their <hi>Dioceſſes,</hi> or
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:105665:127"/> the 40th part of them: indeed I know not of one. And I moſt humbly offer it to our <hi>Superiors,</hi> whether in a time when they are ſtruggling for the very life of our <hi>Religion</hi> againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> they can ſhut out <hi>Eminently Learned</hi> and <hi>Pious Men,</hi> becauſe they durſt not ſubmit to this <hi>Injunction,</hi> which moſt certainly can pretend to nothing of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> elder then the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> 451 years after Chriſt, when abundance of <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Popiſh traſh</hi> was crept into the <hi>Rituals</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Nay I hope to make it good that no ſuch thing had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment by that <hi>Council.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>

               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:105665:127"/> and confirms 79 <hi>Canons</hi> made by them. It goes on with 25 <hi>Canons</hi> of the Synod at <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the year 341; then it confirms 59 <hi>Canons</hi> of the Synod of <hi>Laodicea</hi> made 364, and 7 <hi>Canons</hi> made by the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> made in the year 383, and 8 made in the <hi>General Council</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in the year 431.

            <p n="22">22. The Argument from <hi>Singing by Forms</hi> is as improper, for a <hi>Form is neceſſary</hi> there, how elſe can a whole Congregation ſing the ſame thing?

That in a ſolemn day of Worſhip, the whole <hi>Congregation</hi> met, and called to <hi>Ezra</hi> for <hi>the Book of the Law,</hi> he brings it, they read in it <hi>from the Morning to Mid-day,</hi> v. 1, 2. After this we read of many <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> who <hi>read in the Book of the Law, diſtinctly,</hi> and <hi>gave the People the ſenſe of it, and made them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the reading thereof;</hi> but we read not a word of their <hi>Book of Prayers,</hi> either there, or in any other part of Scripture: We read in <hi>Luke</hi> that when our Saviour came into the Synagogue on the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> they brought him the <hi>Book of the Prophet Iſaiah,</hi> he read in it and preached out of it, but neither there do we read of the Book of 18 <hi>Prayers</hi> brought forth.

Our <hi>Vindicator</hi> ſaith their very <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were <hi>Rites of Supplications,</hi> and as to them they were <hi>limited, and uſed no ſuch Variety.

               <hi>matter</hi> to be inlarged in words, as the <hi>Jewiſh Miniſter</hi> thought fit.

He <hi>adviſeth the conſideration of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, for this life, and that which is to come,</hi> and inſtanceth in many, p. 536, 537. 4. <hi>He ſheweth the neceſſity of the exerciſe of Faith in Prayer,</hi> and directeth the different exerciſe of it in Petitions for <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Eternal good things,</hi> 538, 539, 540, 541. Then he comes and directs men what to pray for others, and how. 5. He directs that the matter of Prayer, <hi>Cogitetur ac Ricitetur,</hi> ſhould not only be <hi>Endited</hi> in and by the <hi>Heart,</hi> but <hi>Recited</hi> by the Lipps. He again repeateth the <hi>Matter, and Order, and Method,</hi> and juſtifieth the lawfulneſs of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:105665:142"/> begging <hi>Temporal good things,</hi> and giveth reaſons for it, anſwering the Arguments of ſome againſt <hi>Praying for Temporal good things,</hi> to p. 555, and 556. He tells us there may be Prayer <hi>Gemitu</hi> by a ſigh; but it is profitable both for the <hi>Younger and Elder to keep a well ordered Form</hi> in <hi>Compellation of the true God, that they may diſtinguiſh true Chriſtian Prayers from thoſe of Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Pagans, minding us of the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and comprehending the certain matter of Prayer.</hi> Such he ſaith were <hi>Jacobs Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and many others Recorded in the <hi>Prophets:</hi> p. 557, he ſaith let us therefore accuſtom our ſelves to <hi>Recital,</hi> and we may uſe well compoſed Forms without Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Magick (that is provided thoſe Forms have no Superſtition in them, nor are thought to have a <hi>Magical Vertue</hi> or <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> from the meer ſound of ſuch and ſuch words rather than other, for which no reaſon can be given.) Let us not (ſaith he) recite the Hymns of <hi>Homer, Orpheus,</hi> or <hi>Callimachus,</hi> but let our Souls move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, with a confidence in Chriſt revealed. He adds in the ſame page <hi>many Lazy, Drunken, Careleſs perſons contemn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital in Prayer, but (ſaith he) let good Men be perſwaded to accuſtome themſelves to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for which he giveth Reaſons;</hi> after which come in the words at firſt cited. I can underſtand nothing by this, but that many <hi>Lazy, Drunken, Careleſs Papiſts,</hi> both <hi>Prieſts</hi> and others, deſpiſed <hi>Vocal

            <p>
               <hi>Melancthon</hi> doth indeed ſay (but it is three ſides before in my book) That <hi>a well ordered Form may be uſeful both for young and old,</hi> provided men did not uſe it <hi>Supe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith) was admirably done, and no more then we do for our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or <hi>Neighbours</hi> (who have not Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to pray without a Form) and allow to be done for any ſuch who in the preſent State of any Church are to be allowed as Miniſters, tho they are deficient in Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Gifts. Only one <hi>Queſtion</hi> cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my mind. Suppoſe there were Publick Forms then uſed in the <hi>Churches</hi> thereabouts: Was there a <hi>Collect</hi> for <hi>Conſtantines ſucceſs in his Wars at that time, or in general, and a proportionable thanksgiving</hi> yea or no? If not, then ſurely <hi>Forms</hi> are not ſo <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive</hi> as <hi>Prayers</hi> in a <hi>Publick Service</hi> of God ſhould be. If there were any ſuch <hi>Collect,</hi> why doth <hi>Conſtantine</hi> make another and not take that? It is a great Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that in that age there were none, and Miniſters being left to their Abilities to pray in the <hi>Chriſtian Congregations;</hi> there was gteat reaſon <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſhould other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe provide for thoſe that might not come in the <hi>Chriſtian Aſſemblies.</hi> Let the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> take which tine of the Fork he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it killeth, inſtead of helping him in the caſe of <hi>Set Forms.</hi>

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>IT is now <hi>Reader</hi> high time to have done drawing this <hi>Saw</hi> which will goe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I remember in the Ancient Practice of the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> after the <hi>Pars Rea</hi> or (as we call him) the <hi>Defendant,</hi> had put in his Anſwer to the Promoters <hi>Libel,</hi> ſo as there was <hi>Lis conteſtata</hi> (as we call it Iſſue joined) the <hi>Promoter</hi> or his <hi>Proctor</hi> took an Oath which they called <hi>Juramentum Calumniae,</hi> and expreſſed in theſe terms:
<q>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:105665:152"/>
                     <l>Illud juretur, quod lis tibi juſta videtur.</l>
                     <l>Et ſi quaeretur verum, non inficietur.</l>
                     <l>Nil promittetur, nec falſa probatio detur</l>
                     <l>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t lis tradetur, dilatio nulla petetur.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>That is the Promoter was to ſwear, <hi>That he believed he had juſt cauſe of action. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked he would not deny the truth, That he would promiſe no Bribe,</hi> nor bring <hi>in any falſe Teſtimony, nor without juſt cauſe delay any proceedings.</hi> I have obſerved likewiſe ſome Writers of late interpoſing ſome So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn <hi>Profeſſions</hi> and <hi>Proteſtations;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others our Vindicator ſaith thus, p. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I do freely profeſs, that beſides what concerns the Laws of the Church and of the Realm, that I account my ſelf to have as plain Evidence from the Laws of God and the Conſtitution of the Chriſtian Church, that <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nneceſſary Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> is a ſin in the breach of Chriſtian Unity, as that Adultery is a ſin, in the breach of Wedlock. And I account my ſelf to be <hi>as certain</hi> that if ever there were, an unwarrantable Separation from any known Church ſince the Apoſtles time, the ſeparation from the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſuch, ſince our Church is truly as free from any juſt exception in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, Doctrine, and Worſhip, as any other ſince that time, either was or is.</q> — A very large Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only in like manner enter my <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:105665:152"/>1. <hi>That I do believe all unneceſſary Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from any Church of which we are, or have been Members, is Sinful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I am equally certain, That <hi>Seperation is neceſſary, where Miniſters or People cannot keep communion without ſin, or ſo far forth, as they cannot do this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I have the ſame certainty, That the <hi>practical judgment of Miniſters or Peoples Conſciences, muſt (as to their practice) determine what is lawful and unlawful; tho it be a falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgment; and they are therefore bound to uſe the beſt means they can for information, before they form it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. I do in like ſincerity profeſs, <hi>That I have wilfully omitted no means of a true Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as to the Will of God in this Cauſe, and I do truly believe it is not lawful for me as a Miniſter of Chriſt ordinarily to perform my Miniſterial Acts in Publick Solemn Prayer by the preſcribed Forms of other Men, not Divinely Inſpired; nor yet, being Solemnly ſet apart to the Miniſtry, wholly to forbear Preaching</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. There are many other things which I cannot but judge ſinful, without the doing of which I can have no ſtation in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Miniſtry. <hi>Reordination, Aſſent, and Conſent, Ceremonies, Promiſcuous Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords Supper,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I do believe the <hi>Vindicator hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a juſt Anſwer to one Argument I brought in this cauſe, and I profeſs my Arguments remain ſtill ſuch as I cannot Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. I do finally profeſs, That I have not
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:105665:153"/> wilfully brought any thing in any of my dicourſes on this Argument (laying any ſtreſs upon it) which I have not believed to be true: Nor have I been bribed, with any hopes of Reward, or Preferment. Nor have I quoted any Author (to my knowledge) falſly or partially, hardly three which I have not ſeen with my own Eyes, unleſs I have told the Reader otherwiſe: Nor have I done any thing to keep my Reader from a true underſtanding of the thing in Queſtion, nor gone about to blind him with Digreſſions, Prejudices, or Impertinent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, nor (further then the Nature of the matter doth it) have I loaded my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary with <hi>Odium, Envy,</hi> or <hi>Prejudice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence all may obſerve, what need we have for to exerciſe a further <hi>Charity</hi> then is yet to be found amongſt us, and a greater liberty in <hi>Religious Worſhip</hi> then we are yet ſo happy to injoy; and that without it we are never like to come to our deſired <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> If there were only this ſingle point in difference, <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> ſeem to me as likely to unite as <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and thoſe of our <hi>Vindicators</hi> perſwaſion. The good Lord ſhew us a more likely way for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> then all <hi>Miniſters</hi> uſing the ſame <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Syllables</hi> in the Acts of their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip; which is a kind of Union, <hi>no where required,</hi> no <hi>where promiſed, no where found,</hi> nor <hi>ever to be expected,</hi> and of which there is no neceſſity at all.</p>

               <hi>BEcauſe our</hi> Vindicator <hi>is ſo mightily confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that if ever there was a</hi> Sinful Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>in the World, the</hi> Diſſenters, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho they agree in the</hi> Doctrine of <hi>the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England (<hi>and poſſibly more heartily, then ſome others who profeſs only to ſubſcribe the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles</hi> in their own ſenſe, <hi>and as</hi> Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Peace) <hi>and in the ſame</hi> Acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>and do not condemn the</hi> Church <hi>or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of</hi> England <hi>as no Churches, are guilty, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of ſuch a</hi> Sinful Separation. <hi>I ſhall crave leave to mind him of an Argument to the contrary brought this laſt Commencement at</hi> Cambridge (<hi>I ſuppoſe the</hi> Vindicator <hi>might hear it) which the Auditors did not judge they heard ſufficiently anſwered by the Dr.</hi> Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>It was this.</hi>

            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>To Separate</hi> (or withdraw rather) <hi>from a Church which doth not acknowledge the true Miniſters of Chriſt as ſuch: is no Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Separation.</hi> But to ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England</hi> is to ſeparate from a Church that diſowns the true Miniſters of Chriſt to be ſuch. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

               <hi>The</hi> Minor <hi>was proved becauſe</hi> it will not own Miniſters ordained by meer Presbyters to be true Miniſters, <hi>and ſo conſequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owneth the Miniſtry of all Forraign Churches, which by ſeveral Acts of Parliament</hi> (3 <hi>at leaſt, one</hi> 13 Eliz. <hi>another made in the</hi> Parl. 1660, <hi>and the</hi> late Act for Uniformity) <hi>are acknowledged true Miniſters. The trite anſwer,</hi> That it is in a caſe of neceſſity <hi>(thoſe Churches having no
<pb facs="tcp:105665:154"/> Biſhops to ordain Miniſters) is pitiful, for no caſe of</hi> neceſſity <hi>can make one to be that</hi> which <hi>by the</hi> Law of Chriſt he is not; <hi>nor was there any</hi> neceſſity <hi>that our</hi> Parliaments <hi>ſhould ſo</hi> own them <hi>in three Acts.

            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Baſis <hi>of this</hi> Argument <hi>is alſo much larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. It is this:</hi>
